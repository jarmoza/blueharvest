<item>Typescript made in 1885 by James Redpath from his notes of Clemens’s dictation, corrected by him and revised by
        Clemens.</item>
</list>
<lb></lb>
<p rend="noindent">The TS was prepared in 1885 by James Redpath, who used a typewriter with only capital letters to transcribe his
       stenographic notes of Clemens’s dictation. He left the pages unnumbered; the texts are published in this edition in the order
       in which they were dictated, as determined by subject matter, references to topics mentioned earlier, specific dates in the text, and
       type of paper. (For a fuller discussion of this evidence, see the Textual Commentary for “About General Grant’s
       Memoirs.”) Redpath’s typed punctuation was sparse and idiosyncratic, but when he reviewed the TS he hardly improved it:
       he left some exceedingly long sentences without punctuation, while elsewhere he added commas to nearly every phrase. He also made a
       few substantive changes that do not appear to be revisions, but rather corrections reflecting his memory of what Clemens dictated.
       Clemens reviewed some of the marked dictations in July, August, and September 1885: there are authorial marks on “A Call with
       W. D. Howells on General Grant” and “About General Grant’s Memoirs,” and possibly on “Grant and
       the Chinese.” He made most of his revisions in ink, occasionally using purple or black pencil, while Redpath wrote in black
       and purple pencil, and in ink only rarely. The medium of inscription is therefore often the primary evidence used to distinguish
       their revisions. Clemens’s review was cursory; he made few corrections, improving awkward wording but seldom deleting or
       altering Redpath’s punctuation—whether typed or inserted—and supplying his own only sporadically. Both men
       overlooked obvious typographical errors. Clemens was dissatisfied with this first effort at dictating a literary work, and never did
       “jack-plane” the text to correct the “rude construction &amp; rotten grammar” as he intended (see the
       editorial headnote).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Because Redpath was not skilled—unlike Josephine Hobby—the editorial policy applied to the Grant
       Dictations is necessarily an exception to the general policy described in the <ref corresp="#bm0017" type="chapterref">Note on the
       Text</ref>. All of Clemens’s marks have been adopted and reported. The typed punctuation has likewise been retained, and
       Redpath’s handwritten substantive revisions have been accepted. Redpath’s added handwritten punctuation, however, has
       been evaluated to determine its similarity to Clemens’s own predominant style. Punctuation that is highly uncharacteristic of
       Clemens has been rejected, and the rest adopted. This judgment was based on a careful study of Clemens’s manuscript usage in
       letters and other holograph documents. For example, when Redpath added a comma or semicolon before a clause beginning with
       “but,” or after a clause beginning with “when” or “whenever,” it accords with the
       author’s demonstrable practice and has been accepted. In addition, whenever Clemens revised the punctuation on the typescript,
       any punctuation inscribed by Redpath in the same sentence is likewise adopted, on the assumption that Clemens, who was demonstrably
       attentive to the punctuation, gave it his tacit approval. Another characteristic of the TS is its entire lack of semicolons and
       abundance of colons. This peculiarity has not been explained, since even the earliest typewriters had a semicolon key, and
       Redpath’s revisions prove that he did occasionally use semicolons. Some typed sentences consist of several clauses connected
       by a series of colons, a style of punctuation that Clemens is not known to have used. A few colons have therefore been editorially
       altered to semicolons or, more rarely, commas. Since there are no lowercase letters in the TS, all lowercase letters have been
       necessarily supplied by the editors, guided by the author’s predominant usage. Rejected variants in the apparatus entries are
       <hi rend="italic">not</hi> represented as they appear in the TS, in full capitals.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">To avoid an excessively long list of trivial entries, the following errors have been silently corrected or
       removed (that is, they are not reported): periods and commas typed together (‘copies.,’); two words typed as one
       (‘emptyin’); words typed with one letter typed over another; contractions spelled with spaces (‘did
       n’t’); periods missing at the ends of paragraphs; and superfluous dots and dashes typed at line ends, apparently added
       to indicate the continuation of a sentence on the next line (‘no . . . | discredit’ and
       ‘gets— | started’). In addition, the errors that Redpath corrected while typing are not listed, including
       changes in wording, and mistypings that he corrected by hand are not listed if they do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> form words (such as
       ‘emeny’ and ‘mainle’), if they result from physical features of the page (‘<del>no</del> |

       Paine when he published the Grant Dictations in <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Redpath corrected the TS in both black and blue pencil. Clemens reviewed the text in August and September 1885,
       several months after it was dictated, revising it more extensively than the other dictations. He began using a purple pencil, and
       then switched to ink. The piece consists of three sections. The first begins the account of Grant’s memoirs
       (75.27–86.10); the second tells of Gerhardt’s bust of Grant (86.11–91.18); and the third concludes the account
       of the memoirs. Paine published, in <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>,</hi> the first section and
       most of the third as continuous text, followed by the middle section as a separate piece. The TS has no typed page numbers; the
       numbers penciled at the top appear to be Paine’s. In his efforts to assemble the TS for publication, Paine numbered the first
       section 1–23, and the third (with a note to himself to ‘continue paging’), 24–32. He apparently first
       intended to attach the middle section to the end of “Gerhardt,” numbering it 5–16 to follow the four typescript
       pages of that piece. Ultimately, he decided not to include “Gerhardt,” renumbered the middle section 1–12,
       entitled it “Gerhardt and the Grant Bust,” and placed it <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the “Memoirs”
       piece. This section on the bust has been interpolated here between the two sections about the memoirs on the basis of several pieces
       of evidence. First, Clemens calls it a ‘diversion’ (86.11) from the topic of the memoirs, to which he returns at 91.19.
       Second, his mention of specific dates confirms that the bust material was dictated before the last section about the memoirs (see
       ‘May 22’ at 91.15 and ‘May 25’ at 92.37). Finally, his reference to ‘that dilatory
       committee’ (at 86.21–22) alludes to the material in “Gerhardt” (74.1–75.26), and must therefore
       follow that piece but precede the concluding “Memoirs” section. The paper of the TS confirms this sequence: the first
       four Grant pieces and pages 1–16 of “Memoirs” are typed on “Linen 1883”; pages 17–23 on the
       memoirs are on unwatermarked paper with blue lines; while a third paper, “Parchment Linen,” was used for the material
       on the Grant bust, the last portion on the memoirs, and “The Rev. Dr. Newman,” which concludes the dictations.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Although there is evidence of attempts by Redpath and Clemens to organize the Grant material, it does not
       contradict the order of the present text, and there is no indication that Clemens intended to remove the ‘diversion’
       about the Gerhardt bust from its original place in the sequence. The TS show the imposition of section numbers by Redpath and
       subsequently by Clemens. On the verso of page 7 of the “Memoirs” typescript (ending ‘offer which in’ at
       79.1) Redpath wrote, ‘Autobiography of Mark Twain | About Gen Grants Memoirs | Part I’; on the verso of page
       16, following Clemens’s added note of 1 or 2 July (83.9–15), he wrote ‘II | Gen Grant’s Memoirs
       | Cont<hi rend="superscript">d</hi>’ (apparently intending the second part to begin at 83.16); on the verso of page 19
       (ending ‘February, 1885.’ at 84.26) he wrote ‘III’; and on the verso of page 23 (ending with
       Clemens’s added note, ‘Afterwards . . . schooling.’ at 86.7–10) he wrote ‘III | Gen
       Grant’s Memoirs | Contd.’ Clemens, when reviewing all of the Grant dictations he had so far completed, wrote
       ‘I’ at the top of “Grant and the Chinese,” ‘II’ at the top of page 1 of “About
       General Grant’s Memoirs,” and ‘III’ at the top of page 17 (83.23) in ink. He (or Redpath) wrote
       ‘IV’ at the top of page 24 in pencil, where the last section begins (91.19).</p>

<item>Manuscript of 29 leaves, written in 1890 and 1893–94.</item>

<lb></lb>
<p rend="noindent">The MS was apparently written in two stages. Part 1, pages numbered 1–20, ending with
      ‘boss-ship.’ (104.26), was written in black ink on pale-green laid paper, measuring 5½ by 8⅞ inches, and
      dates from the last days of 1890. Part 2, pages numbered 1–9, containing the rest of the text, was written in black ink on torn
      half sheets of cream-colored wove paper, with no embossment or watermark, measuring 5½ by 8¼ inches. Paine noted
      ‘Written about 1891’ on page 1 of the second part, but the paper is a type that Clemens used during the winter of
      1893–94, when he was in New York working with Henry H. Rogers to negotiate with Paige. He was in touch in December and January
      with both Henry S. Ward and Charles R. North (see the note at 106.25–29), and he must have written part 2 sometime before 1
      February, when Paine signed a new contract. There are penciled revisions by both Clemens and Paine on part 1; their authorship for the
      most part is easy to determine. A few brief passages are canceled in pencil, which makes it difficult to assign responsibility; it
      seems most likely, however, that Paine made these deletions when he prepared <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> The passages are retained in the text and identified below. There are no clearly authorial revisions in pencil on
      part 2, but there are two penciled changes that have been ascribed to Paine. The first, a necessary correction, accords with the
      present text (at 106.25). The second has been rejected. In that instance the MS reads, ‘if I had his <del>nuts</del> in a
      steel-trap’ (106.31); Clemens deleted ‘nuts’ in ink but inserted no alternative word. The phrase was revised in
      pencil to ‘if I had <del>his</del> <del>nuts</del> <add>him</add> in a steel-trap’ in a hand that could be either
      Clemens’s or Paine’s. Clemens made no other revisions in part 2, and on balance it seems more likely that it was Paine
      who made the revision, to avoid offense. In any case, by restoring the original wording (and rejecting Clemens’s incomplete
      revision) we can be sure the reading is authorial.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The MS was numbered in two sequences, 1–20 and 1–28. (Page 20 of the first sequence contains only a
      few words, ending with ‘I’m tired boiling mine at two hundred and twelve’ [111.34–35]). Clemens inserted
      an additional page, which he numbered 11½, comprising a clipping from an unidentified London newspaper with the Diagram of
      London, which has been simulated here. The MS was written in black ink on torn half sheets of cream-colored wove paper with gray graph
      lines, measuring 5¼ by 8¼ inches, and revised in both ink and pencil. Paine noted ‘Written in Vienna’ at the
      top. The subtitle ‘<hi rend="italic">London, Summer,</hi> 1896’ refers to the time of the events described, and not the
      year of writing. Clemens’s comment ‘Here in Vienna’ (112.15) indicates that he wrote the piece between September
      1897 and May 1899, while the family sojourned in that city. It was most likely written in late 1897, when the subject of London was
      fresh in his mind (the family had left London in July and traveled to Weggis, Switzerland, before proceeding to Austria). In addition,
      Clemens is known to have used the same paper in November of that year for other purposes. The piece is published here for the first

<p rend="noindent">In 1866, before writing the manuscript that would be used to typeset H, Clemens had access to the personal journals
      (still extant) kept by two passengers and the captain of the <hi rend="italic">Hornet</hi> during their open-boat ordeal: see <ref corresp="bib32157" type="dbquery">Samuel Ferguson 1866</ref>, <ref corresp="bib32156" type="dbquery">Henry Ferguson 1866</ref>, and
      <ref corresp="bib32155" type="dbquery">Mitchell 1866</ref>. During Clemens’s return from Hawaii to San Francisco in July 1866
      (much prolonged when his ship was becalmed), he made copies of these journals, which he then quoted from in writing H. Although both
      the copies he made and the manuscript in which he quoted from them are lost, sample comparison of the journals with passages quoted in
      H shows that Clemens did not attempt a verbatim or literatim transcription. And despite his claim to have quoted the journals exactly,
      he frequently abridged, reworded, or expanded passages from them, and he more or less freely regularized and normalized their spelling
      and capitalization. The typesetters of H must in their turn have altered such details in his manuscript to conform to their own house
      style.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In writing the MS in 1898 Clemens reused many of the journal quotations as they had been printed in H, either
      by pasting in clippings from tear sheets of it (occasionally altering them with the pen), or by copying them out when they were on the
      opposite side of a clipping about to be pasted in. When copying out he again freely edited the quotations, adding his own paraphrases
      and interpolations. Although most of the quotations were to be set as extracts, he also copied short phrases from H and incorporated
      them into his narrative. Variants in the journal passages in MS copy of H are judged to be deliberate and are adopted, except where
      they are manifestly defective.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The MS was written in gray ink on cream-colored wove paper, measuring 5½ by 8 7/8 inches. Clemens dated it
      1 October 1898. Marion von Kendler typed the MS in Vienna in October or November 1898, and after Clemens revised the typescript he
      sent it to Henry H. Rogers. Rogers later forwarded it to the <hi rend="italic">Century,</hi> which typeset “My Début as a
      Literary Person” from it, published in its November 1899 issue. Although von Kendler’s typescript is now lost, collation
      of the MS against Cent shows some dozens of verbal variants and many more differences in the accidentals (punctuation, spelling,
      etc.), which must have been introduced either by von Kendler, the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> editors and typesetters, or Clemens
      himself.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Since Clemens did not read proof for the <hi rend="italic">Century,</hi> differences between MS and Cent that
      are authorial must have been made on the now-missing TS: for instance, the substitution of ‘nearly as good as new’ for
      ‘nearly as strong and hearty as ever’ (129.17); ‘latitudes were’ for ‘weather was’ (129.29);
      the nautical verb ‘stove’ for the colorless ‘made’ (130.3); the shortening of ‘We are still in a
      good place to be picked up, but seem to make little or nothing on our course toward the isles’ to ‘We are making but
      little headway on our course’ (132.33–34). Not all changes in wording were, however, by Clemens: the change from
      ‘Harper’s Monthly’ to ‘the most important one in New York’ (128.5) and the related change of
      ‘Harper’s printers’ to ‘Eastern printers’ (128.12) are very likely the result of the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>’s not wanting to name a rival magazine. It was probably also the editors (or the typist) who
      normalized such things as ‘18° to 19°’ to ‘18° or 19°’ (131.18), and ‘situation
      and the circumstances’ to ‘situation and circumstances’ (137.10). Compositorial simplification is also evident in
      ‘This was also just and right’ altered to ‘This was also just right’ (134.35), or the substitution of
      ‘of’ for ‘for’ in ‘As a subject for talk’ (134.17–18).The <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> was likewise responsible for the imposition of house styling—numerous changes in punctuation and spelling that
      Clemens would never have made on any typescript, let alone one created for him soon after he completed his manuscript. All changes
      between MS and Cent deemed, on various grounds, to have been made by the typist or the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> editors lack
      Clemens’s authority and are rejected. All changes here attributed to Clemens’s revisions and corrections on the missing
      typescript are adopted since they are judged to be his literary improvements, not changes made specifically for magazine publication.
      The controlling purpose is to reconstruct the text as he left it on the typescript of 1898, since that was the latest stage of
      composition still regarded as a chapter of his autobiography, and that he may have considered for inclusion in 1906. (It was
      presumably at that time that he deleted the title and inserted ‘Chapter of Autobiography written in 1898’.) Two later
      reprints in 1900 and 1903, which he censored at the behest of Henry Ferguson, are discussed below.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">All variants between MS and Cent, as well as variants in the quotations from journals (whether tagged as H
      clipping or MS copy of H), are recorded here. Because Clemens was obliged to alternate between copying out the quotations from the
      journals and simply pasting in the clippings from H, he introduced considerable variation in the formal presentation of these
      quotations. Since he cannot have intended to create this sort of pointless inconsistency, and since the clarity of his text
      (constantly quoting from different sources) tends to be compromised by it, such formal details as the font of dates, the use of
      brackets (or not) around quotations, have been made uniform in the style of known authorial usage, as chiefly indicated in the
      quotations Clemens copied out. And because Clemens was not attempting anything like a literal transcription of the journals, the
      spelling in them has been made uniform with his known practice (‘everything’ rather than ‘every thing’,
      ‘meantime’ rather than ‘mean time’). All editorial changes for this purpose are likewise reported in the
      list of variants, with the sole exception of contractions spelled with a space in the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> (‘is
      n’t’), which are always silently altered to conform to the author’s invariable practice
      (‘isn’t’).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The following list identifies which journal quotations printed as extracts were clipped from the 1866 <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> and pasted into the MS. In the margin next to each Clemens wrote ‘small type’,
      indicating that they were to be treated as extracts. (Only one <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> clipping of his own words was
      pasted into the MS, and it was marked ‘NOT small type’: ‘Each . . . once.’ at 130.21–28.)
      Clemens made six holograph changes on the clippings he used: one deletion, two inserted footnotes, two added underscores, and the
      correction of one typographical error.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">May 2</hi> . . . overboard.’ (130.35–131.2)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">May</hi> 4 . . . can.’ (131.16–21)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">Henry</hi> . . . before.’ (133.15–18)</p>

<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">May 23</hi> . . . issue!’ (136.12–17)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> . . . us—that’ (136.32–38)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘God’s . . . <hi rend="italic">Log.</hi>’ (138.32–139.1)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘Two . . . <hi rend="italic">Log.</hi>’ (139.5–41)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">Note</hi> . . . picked up.’ (140.7–141.5)</p>

<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="smallcaps">henry</hi> . . . hunger are’ (142.3–21)</p>
<lb></lb>
<p rend="text-indent:2">For the following passages, Clemens copied out the quotations as published in H and likewise marked them for
      ‘small type’. Variants introduced by Clemens in this way are deemed intentional and adopted.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘Passed . . . <hi rend="italic">Log.</hi>’ (134.40–41)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘is, . . . distress.’ (136.38–137.5)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘Two . . . <hi rend="italic">Log.</hi>’ (137.29–30)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘The captain . . . them.’ (138.20–21)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘The two . . . <hi rend="italic">Log.</hi>’ (138.25–27)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">June 1</hi> . . . management—with’ (138.30–32)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘<hi rend="italic">June 2 . . . Hornet.</hi>’ (139.3–4)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">‘awful . . . again. . . . .’ (142.21–143.3)</p>
<lb></lb>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The MS is likewise the source of all the briefer quotations of diary material copied from the <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> article that Clemens integrated into his text—i.e., which he did not mark for smaller type. These
      quotations are too numerous to list separately (the first is ‘Kept . . . off.’ at 132.5), but the changes that
      he made when copying (barring only punctuation changes required to incorporate the quotations) are also reported and adopted.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens did further revise the text of Cent before reprinting it in <hi rend="italic">The Man That Corrupted
      Hadleyburg and Other Stories and Essays</hi> (<ref corresp="bib31093" type="dbquery">SLC 1900b</ref>, 84–127), but he did so
      only at the behest of Henry Ferguson (see the Explanatory Note<!--xref--> at 129.20–22). Three years later he reprinted the
      text a second time, also from Cent, in <hi rend="italic">My Début as a Literary Person with Other Essays and Stories,</hi> volume
      23 in The Writings of Mark Twain (<ref corresp="bib31250" type="dbquery">SLC 1903a</ref>, 11–47). For that reprinting Clemens
      once again incorporated the revisions he had made for the earlier book. All substantive variants in the later texts (labeled
      “Hadleyburg” and “Début”) are reported in the following list (not the main record of variants), but
      none has been adopted as uncoerced literary improvements.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The MS was written in black ink on torn half sheets of cream-colored laid paper, measuring 4⅞ by 7 15/16
      inches. At the top of the first page Paine noted ‘Written about 1898’, the date he assigned to his text in <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>. But composition must in fact have been two years later, for on MS
      page 32 Clemens refers to ‘Charles Warren Stoddard, the Californian poet, now (1900) Professor of English literature in the
      Roman Catholic University, Washington’ (161.27–28). As he wrote the MS, Clemens made the usual number of revisions and
      corrections, and Jean copied these correctly (for the most part) in TS Jean. (She also made some errors, for example, omitting
      ‘the pathetic past’ at 157.20 and ‘troubled’ at 159.1.) Even though the MS had been typed, Clemens
      returned to it sometime after 1902 and inscribed ten changes. Seven were in pencil: he replaced ‘and’ with a comma
      (155.4), and changed ‘smoked’ to ‘dried’ or ‘smo’ to ‘dr’ five times (156.15,
      157.26, 157.29 twice, 157.30), and deleted ‘young and’ (see the entry for ‘blameless’ at 158.25). Three
      changes were in ink: he replaced ‘Selections’ with ‘Scraps’ in the title; replaced ‘spelling
      borrowed from Artemus Ward.’ with ‘it was masquerading in a Southern dialect.’ (161.14); and added ‘on
      that side of the water,’ (161.26). Although these revisions were orphaned on the MS, they are nevertheless adopted here as
      Clemens’s latest refinements of his text.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">TS Jean was revised by Clemens, possibly in 1902 but certainly by August 1906, and again in 1907. There are
      only three revisions, all in ink, on the first section of TS Jean. Two were adopted: ‘seed’ was changed to
      ‘seen’ at 156.15 and ‘a’ to ‘my’ at 157.13. An inserted ellipsis at the beginning of the
      piece was rejected in favor of the manuscript reading. In August 1906 Josephine Hobby created TS3 from the first section of TS Jean to
      serve as printer’s copy for NAR 2, adopting the three revisions at that time. TS3 comprises a total of twenty-four pages and
      includes “Robert Louis Stevenson and Thomas Bailey Aldrich” as well as excerpts from the ADs?of 3 April and 21 May 1906
      (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 1<!--xref-->). The second section of “Scraps” was published in NAR 17, where
      it is paired with material from the AD of 15 October 1906. NAR 17 was typeset directly from TS Jean, which Clemens had by then further
      revised in lead pencil, blue pencil, and, finally, in ink.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The typewriter Jean used to type TS Jean was capable of typing an underscore to indicate emphasis, but she used
      this method only rarely. Instead, to indicate italics for words Clemens had underscored in MS, she doubled the word’s initial
      letter: ‘vvery’ for ‘<hi rend="underline">very</hi>’. When George Harvey read the first section of TS Jean
      in August 1906 while selecting text for the NAR, he corrected one of these doubled letters and overlooked another, but added no
      underscores. Hobby typed TS3 using underscore only where Jean had used it (‘<hi rend="underline">Dey eats ’em guts and
      all!</hi>’) but she did not render the words with doubled initial letters as italic and they were printed in roman type in NAR
      2, even though Clemens read proof. Still, he cannot have intended these inadvertent changes in emphasis and they are rejected in favor
      of the MS reading throughout. As Harvey continued to read beyond the excerpt for NAR 2, he apparently began to understand
      Jean’s system, for he canceled the doubled letter and added an underscore in five cases, starting with ‘<hi rend="underline">you</hi>’ at 160.22. When Clemens reviewed the second half of TS Jean in 1907 for publication in NAR 17, he
      underscored all but one of the previously overlooked words. In one instance only, however, Clemens did not supply an underscore to a
      word on which Harvey had deleted the first of the doubled letters: ‘oown’ (at 159.18). Given the care with which Clemens
      attended to nearly a dozen words he had originally italicized in MS, this one omission is taken as deliberate and the present text
      prints the word in roman.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">All changes on TS Jean that are clearly in Clemens’s hand are adopted here. But it is not always obvious
      who made some of the penciled changes. Some were clearly made by Harvey, or by NAR editor David Munro, after TS Jean (printer’s
      copy for NAR 17) had left Clemens’s hands. For example, Munro marked ‘<hi rend="italic">Sunday Mercury</hi>’ for
      roman type, supplying quotation marks around it instead (161.9). These changes are rejected. Four penciled changes are of uncertain
      origin, but they are deemed uncharacteristic of Clemens, and are therefore ascribed to Harvey or Munro and rejected: the alteration of
      ‘nor’ to ‘or’ (158.3); the addition of a comma after ‘me’ (159.3); the substitution of
      ‘36’ for the MS reading ‘42’ (161.33, emended), evidently to reflect the fact that the Tichborne trials
      were not held on Sundays; and the change from ‘botts,’ to ‘bots’ (162.19). Revisions that could have been
      either Harvey’s or Munro’s are labeled “TS Jean-Harvey/Munro.”</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">When marking the second excerpt in 1907 for NAR 17, Clemens noted that the first six pages had already been
      ‘used’, and he presented two options:?a short excerpt of only the middle section beginning ‘But a boy’s
      life’ (157.35), and a longer one consisting of that section plus the story of Jim Wolf and the cats (the excerpt that was
      actually published).</p>

<p rend="text-indent:2">• MSa (section 1), leaves numbered 1–14, contains the text of the introductory narrative; MSb
      (section 3), numbered 1–20 plus 14A and 14B, contains the text of Clemens’s letter to T. Douglas Murray (which he never
      sent), venting his irritation. Both MSa and MSb were written in black ink on torn half sheets of cream-colored laid paper, measuring
      4⅞ by 7 15/16 inches. At the top of MSa Paine noted, ‘Written in 1900’. This date is confirmed by the evidence of
      the paper, which Clemens used for two other pieces written in 1900: “Scraps from My Autobiography. From Chapter IX” and
      “<hi rend="italic">Dollis Hill House, London,</hi> 1900,” inserted in the AD of 27 February 1907. The piece no doubt
      dates from late August or early September of 1900, when Clemens’s anger with Murray was still fresh.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The source documents for section 2 are as follows:</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• MS Intro, Clemens’s manuscript of his “Introduction,” was commissioned by Murray,
      who made a few suggested revisions directly on it (see 3 Sept 99 to Murray, <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>;
      Murray to SLC, 14 Oct 99, <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• TSa is first typescript made from MS Intro by Murray’s typist. TSa was revised heavily by
      Murray in red and black ink, and more lightly by Clemens in pencil and black ink, in a back-and-forth process, each making alterations
      to the other’s suggestions. It appears that the earliest marks were Murray’s, in red ink, followed by Clemens’s,
      in pencil. In addition to their corrections, there are a few revisions marked in pencil by an unidentified person with a neater hand,
      presumably Murray’s typist or secretary, which duplicate Murray’s revisions on TSb ribbon; collation reveals that these
      revisions were inscribed on TSa after TSb was typed. (For example, the revision ‘<del>recognition from the outside</del>
<add>approval from its environment</add>’ at 162.26–27 was inscribed by Murray on TSb ribbon, and then transferred to
      TSa in pencil.) At a later time, Murray heavily canceled most of his revisions in black ink, possibly in an attempt to appease
      Clemens. The sequence of the multilayered and heavily canceled revisions is at times difficult to reconstruct, with both the original
      text and the revisions sometimes irrecoverable.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• TSb is a retyping of TSa that incorporates most of its revisions. TSb ribbon was further revised by
      Murray in pencil. As noted above, many of the TSb ribbon revisions were transferred to TSa in an unidentified hand, and several of
      them were erased on TSb ribbon but remain barely visible.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• TSb carbon was lightly revised by Clemens in ink—without reference to Murray’s revisions
      on TSb ribbon—presumably in 1904, when he prepared the text for publication in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Monthly</hi>
      (see below): many of his revisions are reflected in the <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> printing. These revisions are reported
      only when they support editorial decisions, as explained below in the discussion of textual policy.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• TSc is the typescript that Clemens prepared to show Murray’s revisions. It was made by an
      unidentified typist employed by Clemens (it is on Southern Cross Superfine paper, whereas the other typescripts, produced by
      Murray’s typist, are on St Cuthbert’s Linen paper). The typist was evidently instructed to transcribe TSa, following
      Clemens’s revisions but ignoring Murray’s. Clemens then painstakingly transferred to TSc, in pencil, most of the
      revisions that Murray made on TSa and TSb ribbon; these are labeled TSc-SLC. Clemens clearly intended these revisions to be shown as
      he inscribed them. He added a few markings in ink, which were <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to be shown (that is, they were to become
      part of the text, and not represented as revisions)—paragraph numbers, for example, to clarify his remarks in his letter to
      Murray in section 3 of the piece. At 179.35–36 Clemens alludes to a ‘marginal remark’ of Murray’s that is
      not visible on any surviving document: ‘<hi rend="italic">Is it warrantable to assert that she bragged? Is it in good taste? It
      was assuredly foreign to her character</hi>’; and there are other revisions that Clemens ascribed to Murray on TSc that cannot
      be found on TSa or TSb ribbon. These may of course be Clemens’s deliberate alterations. But it is possible that there was a
      now-lost carbon of TSa, containing revisions that were copied imperfectly to the ribbon copy of TSa.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• TSd. A typescript that incorporates Murray’s revisions on TSb ribbon but not Clemens’s
      revisions on TSb carbon. Clemens began to revise TSd in pencil, but on page 12 he wrote, ‘Botched beyond recognition.’
      There are several corrections on later pages, apparently made by Murray in pencil, but none identifiable as Clemens’s. This
      document was collated to help understand the genesis of the text of section 2, but its variants are not reported.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">• H. The introduction as published in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> incorporates several of
      Clemens’s revisions now on MS Intro that were not transcribed in TSa; evidently they were not yet present when TSa was typed.
      Many of these revisions duplicate those that Clemens wrote on TSb carbon, but collation indicates that TSb carbon could not have been
      the source of the <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> text. Apparently when Clemens decided to publish the piece in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> he copied many of revisions on his TSb carbon into MS Intro and asked Jean to transcribe it: on the
      first page of MS Intro he wrote an instruction to her about a footnote in the <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> text. Clemens
      further revised Jean’s typescript (now lost) before submitting it to <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi>. This printing was
      collated to help understand the genesis of the text of section 2, but its variants are not reported.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The chronology of the revisions on the various typescripts is not entirely clear. The surviving correspondence
      does indicate that by 14 October 1899 Murray had arranged for Clemens’s manuscript to be “beautifully copied in
      type.” On that day he returned the “original MSS of the Introduction” (the plural “MSS” referred to
      the multiple sections of MS Intro), telling Clemens he would bring the typed copy (TSa) “some day,” adding, “You
      may find a little pencil mark here &amp; there” (Murray to SLC, <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>). By 31
      January 1900 Clemens had revised TSa and was ready to return it to Murray: “I enclose the Introduction, corrected &amp;
      reduced. I have retained several of the emendations made, &amp; have added some others.” Sometime between 31 January and
      early May, Murray had a new typescript, TSb, made from the revised TSa. Murray retained TSb ribbon and sent TSb carbon to Clemens. On
      2 May Clemens told Murray, “I think I will wait until you come, for then I can have the copy which I
      corrected”—presumably referring to his need for TSa to help him revise TSb carbon. By 5 August, Clemens had complained
      about Murray’s further editing on TSb ribbon. In reply Murray explained:</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p rend="noindent">Please note that I have only altered copies I had made for myself, as I felt some sort of
      revision was required, and I knew that every moment of your time was occupied with anxious literary work and so I hoped to save you
      time by these suggestions for your approval or the reverse<corr>.</corr></p> <p rend="text-indent:2">I am truly sorry to have departed
      from the strict literary etiquette; but I erred with the best intent.</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">I do really think that if you will
      take the trouble to read through the clear copy you will feel, as I do, that it has need of some revision. (Murray to SLC, 5 Aug 1900,
      <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>)</p> </quote>
<p rend="noindent">The clear copy must have been TSd, a retyping of TSb ribbon incorporating Murray’s revisions, but without
      those that Clemens had made on TSb carbon. On 14 August, Clemens was still trying to revise the introduction, presumably on TSd, and
      wanted to compare it to the revised TSa. He wrote to Murray’s wife, “I am waiting for my old type-written copy of the
      Joan of Arc Introduction, which Mr. Murray has forgotten to send to me. Without that, for comparison, I should have to read the whole
      thing through from A to Z, &amp; life is too short for that kind of dissipation” (Craven). He revised only the first twelve
      pages of TSd before deciding it was too “botched” to correct. By 27 August he had grown so annoyed with Murray that he
      withdrew from the project. He asked Murray to destroy all typed versions of the introduction; instead of destroying them, however,
      Murray returned them to Clemens (see the letters quoted in the Explanatory Note at 166.23).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In this edition, the text of Clemens’s original essay (before revisions of any kind) is drawn from TSa;
      Murray’s revisions to the essay are represented by Clemens’s reinscription of them on TSc. The copied revisions are
      retained whether or not they accurately reflect Murray’s actual revisions on TSa or TSb ribbon. Murray’s revisions are
      reported only when they vary notably from Clemens’s representations of them; those that Clemens accurately copied, and those
      that he decided not to copy, are not reported. The readings of the TSc typed layer are always adopted without alteration when they are
      within a deletion that Clemens transferred to TSc. The TSc typed readings that vary from those of TSa have been corrected; the
      corrected readings are adopted from the following sources, in descending order of preference: Clemens’s revisions on TSb carbon
      and MS Intro. All variants between TSa and TSc <hi rend="italic">as typed</hi> are reported in <hi rend="italic">Revisions, variants
      adopted or rejected, and textual notes.</hi> All of Clemens’s revisions of TSa are reported (two deletions, made in pencil,
      could have been the work of either Murray or Clemens, and are identified as TSa-SLC/Murray). Clemens’s revisions on TSb carbon
      are not reported unless they provide evidence to correct TSc.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In three instances Clemens erred in copying a revision to TSc and created a defective text that required
      correction: see ‘and she’ [at 171.37], ‘coward<add>.</add><del>, but</del>’ [at 173.31], and
      ‘<del>go to</del> <add>see</add>’ [at 174.16]). Each of the entries of TSa-TSc variants in the apparatus also records
      the readings of MS Intro and TSb, but there is no complete collation given of TSa or TSc against MS Intro or TSb. Nearly all of the
      variants adopted to correct TSc—from Clemens’s revisions on TSb carbon and from MS Intro—are in spelling and
      punctuation; only three TSc substantives have been altered: ‘multitude’ instead of ‘multitudes’ (167.5),
      ‘victory’ instead of ‘a victory’ (171.30), and ‘remotenesses’ instead of
      ‘remoteness’ (173.18). In three unusual cases where Murray’s substantive revisions on TSa were followed by the
      TSc typist, they are not corrected, on the presumption that Clemens deliberately chose to accept them as if they were his own: the
      insertion of ‘and Rehabilitation’ at 167.4 (which Clemens later added to MS Intro), and two deletions, of
      ‘<del>poor lonesome</del>’ (see the entry for ‘<add>prevailing</add> idea’ at 175.26) and
      ‘<del>easily and</del>’ (see the entry for ‘is’ at 176.3). The application of the general textual policy
      of this critical edition—the correction of outright errors and adoption of uniform spellings—has resulted in a few
      exceptions to the guidelines described here. Murray’s marginal remarks have been styled here in italic type.</p>

<p rend="noindent"> Clemens’s introductory paragraph was written in brown ink on Trent’s letter; he also wrote <hi rend="italic">‘Auto’</hi> in the upper left corner. The paper and ink of the other pages match those used for
      “Something about Doctors,” and are described in its Textual Commentary<!--xref-->. The MS was separated into two parts,
      probably by Paine but possibly earlier. He published part 1—MS pages 1–16 (through ‘ourselves.’ at
      185.10)—in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Monthly Magazine</hi> in August 1922 (<ref corresp="bib32367" type="dbquery">SLC
      1922c</ref>), supplying the subtitle “A Young Author Sends Mark Twain a Book.” He did not publish part 2, but titled it
      “Moral and Intellectual Man” at the head of page 18 (after the clippings). The two parts of the piece have now been
      reunited on the basis of physical evidence: visible on the verso of MS page 16 (the last page of part 1) is the faint image
      (offsetting) of the first newspaper clipping, which is on MS page 17 (the first page of part 2). Given the subjects of the two parts,
      it is not surprising that they have remained separated until now; the relevance of part 2 is not discernible without knowledge of the
      topic of Trent’s book (see the Explanatory Note at 181.3). In 2005 Joe B. Fulton incorrectly conjectured that part 2 was the

<p rend="noindent">TS Hobby was made from an earlier typescript that is now lost, prepared in April 1904 in Florence by Jean Clemens,
      who transcribed the longhand notes taken by Isabel Lyon from Clemens’s dictation. The clipping of the article about Rogers in
      the Boston <hi rend="italic">Sunday Post,</hi> apparently preserved with the typescript, has the notation ‘E. 10’ at the
      top, a clear indication that it was the source of the ‘Boston sketch’ that Clemens mentions at the end of TS Hobby. No
      page numbered E. 9, missing from the pagination sequence, has been found. Paine supplied the title adopted here when he published this
      dictation in <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Pages 1–75 of the MS are torn half sheets of buff-colored wove paper with a faint cross-hatch pattern,
      measuring 5¼ by 8¼ inches. MS pages 76–90, containing the sketch about hunting the turkey, were written on torn half
      sheets of white laid paper watermarked “Joynson Superfine,” measuring 4 15/16 by 8 inches. A typescript was made of the
      MS, possibly in London in 1900, but it is now lost (TS4 has ‘[1900]’ typed at the top). When Clemens decided in June
      1906 to include in <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Mark Twain</hi> some of his rejected earlier efforts to ‘put my life on
      paper’, it was this now-lost typescript that he referred to with the instruction ‘Here insert the 44 old type-written
      pages’, written on the manuscript page following his “Early Attempt” preface (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, pp. 30–32 and 36, and the Textual Commentary for that preface).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Collation shows that Clemens revised the missing typescript, and his revisions were incorporated into both TS2
      (made by Hobby) and TS4. Since these typescripts derive independently, either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the
      other. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they confirm the readings of the missing typescript. All of their variants have therefore been
      reported. Pages 1–17 of TS2 are now lost; they served as printer’s copy for NAR 1. Page 18 of TS2 contains the last
      words of the NAR 1 text and the beginning of the NAR 13 text; pages 19–53 contain the rest of the text of NAR 13, and the story
      published as “The Deceitful Turkey” in <hi rend="italic">Harper’s</hi> (edited, like the NAR, by George Harvey,
      assisted by David Munro). Clemens’s revisions are visible on the extant TS2 pages and on the galley proofs of NAR 13. Collation
      of the MS against TS2/TS4 reveals substantive variants that Clemens must have made on the now-lost typescript. When TS2 is missing,
      however, collation of the MS against NAR 1 shows revisions that he could have made on either of the two missing stages. This critical
      text is based primarily on the MS, modified to include the authorial revisions identified by collation, as well as those visible on
      TS2 and NAR 13pf, whenever they are judged to be literary improvements and not intended solely for NAR publication.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">When Harvey visited Dublin in early August 1906, he selected excerpts from the autobiography for five
      installments in the NAR. Hobby was instructed to create a third typescript, TS3, to serve as printer’s copy for these first
      installments. With the exception of one sketch, TS1 was her source for TS3 (“Scraps from My Autobiography. From Chapter
      IX” was typed from a typescript made by Jean ).“Random Extracts” was not among the first five installments.
      Harvey carried away TS2 through the AD of 12 February 1906, and asked for the rest of TS2 to be forwarded when ready, for further
      review (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, pp. 51–53). Later in the fall, the first part of
      “Random Extracts” was added to launch the series, and the previously selected installments became NAR 2–6. This
      suggests that Harvey did not see TS2 during his visit; had he done so, he almost certainly would have selected “Random
      Extracts” at that time, given its suitability.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In his MS of the “Early Attempt” preface for this sketch, Clemens noted that the ‘first
      part of it is lost’, and then canceled these words (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, <ref corresp="#m00003" type="figref">figure 3</ref>, p. 35). And the opening sentence (‘So much for the earlier days, and the New
      England branch of the Clemenses’) also implies some previous material that does not survive. TS4 does not include the
      epigraphic poem and the heading ‘From Chapter II’ present in the MS: Clemens evidently deleted them on the missing
      typescript when he revised it for <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Mark Twain,</hi> and they are therefore omitted here. The MS also
      contains three unnumbered ‘Chapter’ breaks: one occurs at the beginning of the text published in NAR 13; another falls
      within that text; and the third is at the beginning of the sketch of the turkey hunt. Presumably Clemens planned to supply chapter
      numbers at a later date (that is, numbers other than III, IV, and V), when he assembled the scattered pieces of his autobiography. TS2
      omits the first of these headings, but includes the second and third; TS4 includes all three. Because Clemens did not delete these
      headings on the lost typescript, they are retained in the present text.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In 1907, when Paine helped Clemens to prepare material for NAR 13, he suggested an excerpt of twenty-seven TS2
      pages, ‘net’—that is, the text from where NAR 1 ended through the description of the Quarles farm on TS2 (page
      47), but only if some text were omitted, such as the mention of the girl’s corpse in the cave. As an alternative, he noted that
      the text could end before that passage.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens drafted this second preface for <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Mark Twain,</hi> as he did the first one
      (“An Early Attempt”), in June 1906. It is in three parts: ‘The Latest Attempt’, ‘The Final (and
      Right) Plan’, and ‘Preface. As from the Grave’. TS4—typed by an unidentified typist—is the only
      document that contains the entire three-part preface, which occurs in its pagination sequence after “John Hay,” which
      ends on page 60. In TS2, however, the five pages on which the prefaces presumably were typed (54–58) are now missing: they fall
      between “Random Extracts” (which ends on page 53) and the beginning of “John Hay” (which begins on page
      59; see Contents and Pagination of TS2 and TS4). This is the only instance in which TS2 and TS4 do not agree in the order of their
      material. TS2, typed by Josephine Hobby under Clemens’s supervision, is the more authoritative text, and therefore its sequence
      is adopted, and the preface is placed before “John Hay,” the first Florentine Dictation. All of the variants in TS4 are
      reported because its genesis is not entirely clear: it includes text at the end—an introductory comment about “Notes on
      ‘Innocents Abroad’ ”—that does not appear in any other source (see the Textual Commentary for that
      piece).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The MS includes the first part of the preface, the title of the second part, and the third part of the preface.
      It is on the same cream wove paper as the title page and “An Early Attempt,” and was likewise written in black ink. Its
      pages were numbered 45–52, to follow the ‘44 old type-written pages’ of “My Autobiography [Random Extracts
      from It].” MS page 52 contains only the words ‘Here begin the Florentine Dictations.’</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Although the MS survives for the title of the second part of the preface, ‘The Final (and Right)
      Plan’, the earliest surviving source of the the text itself is TSa. A manuscript of an early draft of this text survives, but
      it was almost certainly not Hobby’s source. The variants between this early draft and TSa strongly suggest that she instead
      transcribed her notes of Clemens’s dictation. Here is the text of the draft, which Clemens wrote in 1902 in a pocket calendar
      for November 1901:</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p rend="noindent">What a wee little part of a person’s life is his acts &amp; his words! His real
      life is led in his head &amp; is known to none but himself. All day long &amp; every day the mill of his brain is grinding
      &amp; his thoughts, not those other things, are his history. His acts &amp; his words are merely the visible thin crust of his
      world, with its scattered snow-summits &amp; its vacant wastes of water—&amp; they are so trifling a part of his bulk! a
      mere skin enveloping it. The mass of him is hidden—it &amp; its volcanic fires that toss &amp; boil &amp; never rest,
      night or day. These are his life, &amp; they are not written &amp; cannot be written. Every day would make a whole
      book—80,000 words; 365 books a year. Biographies are but the clothes &amp; buttons of the man; the biography of the man
      himself cannot be written.</p></quote>
<p rend="noindent">TSa reads ‘part of his book’ instead of ‘part of his bulk’—an error that most
      likely resulted from Hobby’s mishearing of Clemens’s speech. (Clemens corrected ‘book’ to
      ‘bulk’ on TSa.) Other variants between the early draft and TSa also suggest that Hobby did not transcribe a manuscript.
      Clemens added the page number 1½ at the top of TSa, apparently intending to insert it after his title page, on MS page 1. After
      he revised TSa, Hobby retyped it and followed it with the rest of the MS text, ‘Preface . . . Dictations.’ In
      the MS, nothing intervenes between the heading ‘The Final (and Right) Plan’ and the third part of the preface. TSb and
      TS4 (which derives from the revised TSa and does not capture the revisions on TSb) confirm that Clemens inserted the text of the
      second part (‘I will . . . be written.’) under the title, where it appears in this edition. At the top of
      ‘Preface. As from the Grave’ in TSb, Clemens wrote in the margin, <hi rend="italic">‘small type’</hi> and
      <hi rend="italic">‘small type,</hi> to save space’, repeating the instruction on every subsequent page.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The third part, ‘Preface. As from the Grave’, is a much-expanded version of a draft that Clemens
      wrote on the typescript of the title page for <hi rend="italic">Autobiography of Mark Twain.</hi> The draft reads:</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p rend="text-indent:2">To heirs and assigns:</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">1. Whereas about a twentieth part of
      this Autobiography can be published (in serial form, not in book form) while I am alive, no large portion of it must see print in any
      form during my lifetime. </p> <p rend="text-indent:2">2. Words of mine which can wound the living must <hi rend="italic">wait</hi>
      until later editions. This book is not a revenge-record. </p> <p rend="text-indent:2">3. It will be <del>seen</del> noticed that I
      have marked certain chapters which are to be kept suppressed, sealed up, and unprinted for a hundred years. These must not be shown to
      any one, but kept sealed—as I shall leave them.</p></quote>
<p rend="text-indent:2">On the last page of TS4 (65)—below ‘Here begin the Florentine Dictations.’—is an
      explanatory remark found in no other source: ‘To precede A. A. | This will concern my life where it departs from
      “Old Times on the Mississippi,” and enters upon the life recorded in “Roughing It.” ’ The
      designation ‘A. A.’ (otherwise unexplained) appears on both TS2 and TS4 above the title of “Notes on
      ‘Innocents Abroad.’ ” Although it is possible that Clemens intended this note to ‘precede’ that
      dictation, it seems more likely to be a memorandum or instruction that refers to an abandoned idea.</p>

<p rend="noindent">TS2 and TS4 derive independently from an earlier typescript, now lost, prepared in 1904 in Florence by Jean
       Clemens, who transcribed the longhand notes taken by Isabel Lyon from Clemens’s dictation. Since either typescript may
       incorporate authorial readings not present in the other, all of their variants have been reported. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they
       confirm the readings of the missing TS Jean.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Clemens revised TS2 to serve as printer’s copy for the NAR, cutting away most of page 65 and all of
       page 66. TS4 contains the complete text, and is therefore the unique source for the portion missing from TS2. This excerpt about Hay
       was first paired with an anecdote from the AD of 15 March 1906 about Twichell and the barking dog and scheduled for NAR 8 (see the
       Textual Commentary<!--xref--> for that dictation). Ultimately it was combined with Clemens’s comments about his brother Orion
       from the ADs of 5 April and 6 April 1906 (a topic begun in NAR 11) and published in NAR 12. Someone at the NAR apparently considered
       shortening the installment on NAR 12pf by marking the entire text of “John Hay” for deletion, but then restored it with
       the instruction ‘stet’. A phrase in the TS2 text—‘instead of an ungrateful one’
       (224.17)—was omitted from NAR 12pf. The same sentence was cut further before publication: the phrase ‘and would be
       President next year if we were a properly honest and grateful nation’ (224.16–17) was in NAR 12pf but omitted from NAR
       12. The source of these revisions, which are not on any extant document, was probably someone at the NAR. Clemens himself made no
       revisions on this portion of NAR 12pf.</p>

<p rend="text-indent:2">On the last page of TS2 (page 80) is a list of topics, which Clemens canceled (the corresponding page in TS4,

       Evans | Riley | Greeley the Inexhaustible | Johns ditto | Soule | Hastings | (Sewell) | Mrs.
       Clemens reads proofs (?)’. None of these people—all of them, except Greeley, acquaintances from Clemens’s years
       in California and Washington, D.C., in 1861–68—is discussed in other material dating from 1904, nor is there any
       mention of his wife’s reading the proofs of <hi rend="italic">The Innocents Abroad,</hi> which he did allude to, however, in
       the AD of 14 February 1906. Clemens mentions Bret Harte, Prentice Mulford, Charles Henry Webb, and Hastings in the AD of 13 June 1906
       (for Harte and Mulford see “Ralph Keeler,” note at 150.2–4; for Webb see <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00005" type="dbquery">L1</ref>,</hi> 314 n. 5, and <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00006" type="dbquery">L2</ref>,</hi> 6–7; Hastings has not been identified). Riley is mentioned in the AD of 15 January 1906 (see the Explanatory
       Note at 282.15–18), and the story of Greeley and Hank Monk is told in the AD of 31 August 1906 (see also “Horace
       Greeley”). Clemens discusses Noah Brooks in the present piece (see the Explanatory Note at 228.3–6). There are no
       comments in the autobiography about Albert S. Evans, Frank Soulé, G. T. Sewall, or Tremenhere Johns. For Albert S.

<p rend="noindent">The original source of the text is now lost; it was a typescript prepared in 1904 in Florence by Jean Clemens, who
       transcribed the longhand notes taken by Isabel Lyon from Clemens’s dictation. During his visit to Dublin in August 1906,
       Harvey selected material for the first five installments of the NAR, and Hobby was instructed to prepare a typescript, TS3, to serve
       as printer’s copy (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 1<!--xref-->). TS2 (also lost), TS3, and TS4 must have all
       derived from the 1904 typescript, which also served as the source of another excerpt included in NAR 2 (the first half of
       “Scraps from My Autobiography. From Chapter IX”). TS3 agrees with TS4 in all of its substantive readings; although TS4
       has less authority than TS3—which Clemens revised—its variants are reported, because it may incorporate authorial
       readings not present in TS3. Only one of its readings has been adopted (‘equaled’ at 229.14). When TS3 and TS4 agree,
       they confirm the readings of the missing TS Jean.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens made a few additional corrections on NAR 2pf. An unidentified NAR editor wrote ‘<hi rend="italic">Stevenson</hi>’, a question mark, and ‘IV’ on the first page of TS3, indicating its section number
       in NAR 2, the others being the first part of “Scraps from My Autobiography. From Chapter IX” and material from the ADs
       of 3 April and 21 May 1906.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Paine supplied the title “Villa di Quarto” when he published this dictation in <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>. TS Jean is the source for the first portion of the text, and TS Hobby, presumably
       made from the now-lost part of TS Jean, is the source for the second portion. The two typescripts do not overlap, and TS Jean is
       clearly incomplete, so there may have been additional text that is now lost. The last portion of the text, a description of the Villa
       Viviani (where the Clemenses stayed during an earlier sojourn in Florence), is based on the MS. Clemens noted at the end of his
       dictated comments that he would include ‘some extracts’ from ‘old manuscripts and random and spasmodic
       diaries’ (244.32–34). The MS was written in black ink on torn half sheets of white laid paper, measuring 5 by 8 inches,
       which Clemens used in 1893 and 1894. Although most of the MS revisions are in ink, several were added later in pencil, probably in
       1906; they are identified below. TS Hobby includes a highly accurate transcription of the MS: it agrees with the MS in all of its
       substantive readings, differing only in its spelled-out numbers and the like. The MS text is adopted here, and the derivative
       (nonauthorial) readings in this portion of TS Hobby are not reported. </p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens revised only the first fifteen pages of TS Hobby; on page 8 he wrote a note to himself, ‘By
       &amp; by, examine page 28 &amp; beyond.’—an indication that he planned to review the Villa Viviani portion of the
       text at a later date (the MS transcription begins on page 27). He never revised the text on any extant document. Hobby apparently
       transcribed all or nearly all of “Villa di Quarto” into TS2, but the pages on which it presumably occurred
       (86–144) are now missing.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">TS Jean contains a large number of mistyped words, and its punctuation often does not reflect Clemens’s
       typical style. Although he revised the typescript, for the most part he merely corrected typing errors, added hyphens to compound
       words, and made other trivial changes. He overlooked a large number of errors, however, often failing to correct glaring mistypings
       while making other more subtle changes. He was inconsistent, for example, in adding an umlaut to ‘Würtemberg’
       (more commonly spelled ‘Württemberg’), correcting possessives such as ‘Countess’s’, and
       substituting prose numbers for numerals. Clemens also revised the first fifteen pages of TS Hobby, again somewhat carelessly. The
       author’s manuscript usage has served as a guide to correct manifestly defective punctuation and inconsistent spelling in both
       TS Jean and TS Hobby. In particular, in passages that Clemens did not revise, commas were added in appositional clauses such as
       ‘her head servant, the steward of the estate,’ (233.11). Although all of his revisions are reported, Jean’s
       self-corrections on the typewriter, as well as a few errors that she corrected in pencil, have not been listed.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Between May and July 1906 Clemens considered publishing an excerpt from this sketch in Samuel McClure’s
       newspaper syndicate. At the top of TS Jean he wrote his calculation of the word count, ‘M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi> (about
       <del>4,000)</del> 3,000)—or 4000’ (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29), and on
       page 8 of TS Hobby he wrote the instruction ‘stop here.’ after ‘satisfactory.’ (239.3), indicating that
       the excerpt was to include all of the text in TS Jean and end on page 8 of TS Hobby. He marked many passages for suppression, noting
       on the back of the second page of TS Jean, ‘Leave out that blue-penciled <add>passage</add> (&amp; <hi rend="italic">all</hi> blue-penciled passages in the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> edition. Restore them in later editions. SLC’. He then
       circled the text he wanted to omit in the same blue pencil, and in some cases inserted an alternative wording in
       ink—suppressing the countess’s name, for example, and referring instead to an ‘American owner of the
       house’ (see the entry for ‘come . . . sex.’ at 231.13–14). All of these passages are
       identified, and their associated alternative readings, if any, are reported.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Typed on page 15 of TS Hobby is the instruction ‘Here Insert Rhone Voyage—Pages 15–a. b.
       c., etc.’, a reference to an unfinished manuscript entitled “The Innocents Adrift” (see the Explanatory Note at
       241.9). There is no indication that Clemens followed through on his intention.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The pages missing from TS1 and TS2 were discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>,</hi> which omits much of the corresponding text. TS4 is therefore the only source for the
      first part of the text, ‘January 9 . . . suggestions from’ (250 <hi rend="italic">title</hi>–254.29).
      For a small portion of the text, TS1 is lost but TS2 survives (251.15–19). Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made
      on TS1 into TS2, and they were incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has no authority for the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is
      missing, however, TS4 was collated and its one variant reported, because TS2 and TS4 derive independently from TS1 and therefore
      either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the other. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they confirm the readings of the missing
      portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> In early 1907 Clemens considered publishing this dictation text in the NAR. Before his review, however, Paine
      read the typescript and suggested several revisions. He also wrote a lengthy marginal note on TS2, summarizing the contents and
      suggesting the addition of excerpts from two later ADs (19 January and 23 January 1906) to make up an installment of twenty-three
      pages. When Clemens decided that none of this dictation was ‘usable’, he (and Paine) had already marked up the last page
      of TS2 (page 160) with instructions about the excerpt from the AD of 19 January that would have followed it. He deleted the end of the
      account of the Big Bonanza on page 160 and added a fictitious dateline—‘<hi rend="italic">Dictated March</hi> 12,
      1906’—in lieu of the title ‘Dueling Again’, which Paine had suggested for the material from the AD of 19
      January. This leaf was temporarily removed from the dictation, and folded and mailed to the NAR along with the rest of the
      printer’s copy for what became NAR 22, even though the only text it contained was the added March dateline.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Since TS2 and TS4 derive independently from the lost TS1, either typescript may incorporate authorial readings not
      present in the other. All of their variants are therefore reported. In nearly all instances the TS2 reading is deemed the more
      accurate and adopted. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they confirm the reading of the missing TS1. TS1 also must have included transcriptions
      of three texts that Hobby inserted at Clemens’s behest. The first, a letter that Clemens received from Laura K. Hudson, was
      transcribed from her original manuscript letter. There is no evidence that he revised the letter, and therefore all variants between
      the original letter and TS2 are rejected as transmissional errors created by Hobby in TS1 (or possibly TS2, when TS2 and TS4
      disagree). The second inserted text is Clemens’s reply to Hudson, for which Hobby’s source is unclear. We have a
      penciled draft that Isabel Lyon made from Clemens’s dictation, but the letter that she wrote for his signature and that was
      sent to Hudson has been found only in Lyon’s fair copy of it, kept as a record. Collation suggests, however, that Hobby
      transcribed the letter sent, and that Clemens revised that document and/or TS1. The readings of TS2/TS4 which are judged to reflect
      his revisions are adopted; the variants in Lyon MS are reported for the evidence they provide about possible authorial revision.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The third inserted text is Clemens’s speech at the Whittier birthday dinner, which he commissioned a
      ‘Boston typewriter’ to find and copy by delving ‘among the Boston papers’ of 1877 (3.10–11). The
      Boston typist transcribed the speech as it had appeared in the Boston <hi rend="italic">Evening Transcript</hi> of 18 December 1877;
      that text derived ultimately from Clemens’s original MS (from which two lines of text have been cut away), and proximally from
      one of four other Boston papers that published the speech earlier in the day (<ref corresp="bib00083" type="dbquery">Smith 1955</ref>,
      p. 156 n. 31). The text of the speech presents an intricate problem because both the original manuscript and the newspaper printing
      derived from it survive, but the 1906 transcription of the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> made by the Boston typewriter, and TS1
      made by Hobby’s copying of that transcription, are both lost. Our intention is to identify and adopt authorial TS1 readings
      (including those Clemens supplied while revising it) as these are recorded in TS2 and TS4, and likewise to identify but reject
      nonauthorial TS1 readings—i.e., those arising from the errors made by the Boston typist or by Hobby herself in creating TS1 and
      recopying it into TS2. TS2 and TS4 derive independently from the lost TS1 and therefore allow a more reliable reconstruction of its
      text than would be possible without them.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">There is no reason to suppose that Clemens was particularly enamored of the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>
      text: it was the Boston typist, not he, who chose that paper’s version of the speech. But Clemens nevertheless undertook in
      1906 to reproduce the speech from the typed copy of the <hi rend="italic">Transcript,</hi> so there is reason to accept the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>’s few departures from the MS, even though he could not have intended those changes in 1877. It is
      clear that in 1906 he was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> intent on preserving every word of the newspaper text, for a comparison with
      TS2/TS4 shows that in a dozen places he revised the wording on TS1, and in doing so he actively adapted the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> text to his immediate purposes. (All authorial revisions on TS1 that have been detected by collation have been
      adopted in the present text.) For example, ‘biggest’, ‘nom de plume’, ‘dad fetch’, and
      ‘dog my cats’ became in TS1 (as witnessed by TS2/TS4) ‘largest’, ‘nom de guerre’,
      ‘consound’, and ‘blamed’ (261.20, 261.25, 261.34). Clemens also reproduced the Boston typist’s
      heading, specifically identifying the source as the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> (‘Address of . . . 1877’
      [261.11–16]) and in the rest of the dictation he made two additional references to the way he had obtained the text of the
      speech (see 264.27–28 and 267.9–10). He also said that he had ‘read it twice’ after receiving it that
      morning (267.10), indicating that he was far from indifferent about how the text read. In fact, one particular revision he made on TS1
      makes especially clear the extent to which he embraced this slightly corrupt copy of the MS. The Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> compositor misread the MS in 1877, for he included a passage of some thirteen words (at the top of MS page 8) which
      Clemens clearly intended to cancel, but had neglected actually to strike out before turning the MS over to the newspapers. The passage
      repeated verbatim part of a speech by the miner which Clemens had just moved toward the beginning of the paragraph. Even though its
      repetition was not intended, it appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> and in every text of the speech derived from it,
      including the Boston typist’s copy, TS1, TS2, TS4, and NAR. The inadvertent repetition of these words nevertheless made a kind
      of sense, for the miner in his perplexity repeats other phrases as well: ‘ “By George, I was getting kind of worked up.
      I don’t deny it, I was getting kind of worked up’ (262.24–25). And it is doubtless for this reason that the
      inadvertently repeated words did not strike anyone, including their author, as an error. It is apparent that in revising TS1, Clemens
      smoothed over what must have struck him as an imperfect rendering of this piece of the text by adding single quotation marks around
      the repeated words and by inserting ‘I says’ to make it clearer that the miner was quoting himself (262.30). So while
      the repetition was clearly not initiated by Clemens, he took deliberate steps to incorporate it in the text he reproduced here, and
      the error must therefore be left uncorrected.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>’s relatively few failures to reproduce the words of the MS and its
      slightly more frequent departure from its spelling and punctuation were, for the most part, not corrected by Clemens and so they have
      not been corrected here. The <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> read ‘cost’ instead of ‘cost you’ at
      262.37, ‘you bet’ instead of ‘you bet you’ at 263.21, and ‘Such was’ instead of ‘Such
      is’ at 264.4. Clemens did correct ‘a game’ to ‘the game’ at 263.9, and he probably corrected some
      of the punctuation as well. The <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> omitted the manuscript’s serial comma after
      ‘Emerson’ at 261.34, but since the MS agrees with TS2/TS4 in restoring it, the author probably made the correction on
      TS1. And even though both the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> and the MS read ‘calmly’ at 262.42, the reading
      ‘ca’mly’ in TS2/TS4 is another sign of authorial tinkering (no typist would have supplied the abbreviated version
      of this word). The chief source of error in TS1 was doubtless the Boston typist’s copy, and since his (or her) errors cannot
      have been intended by Clemens, they are corrected here to conform to the <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> reading. The most glaring
      example is an eye-skip at 263.13–17 that inadvertently dropped some forty words. The chance that Clemens struck out these words
      on TS1 seems remote, and so they are restored here. But Clemens overlooked some minor errors: for example, MS and <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi> both read ‘<hi rend="italic">I</hi>’ve’ at 263.32, but TS2/TS4 reads simply
      ‘I’ve’, which, since there is no sign of wholesale revision of emphasis, is here deemed an error and
      corrected.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Paine helped Clemens select two excerpts for publication. Clemens revised TS2 to serve as printer’s copy
      for NAR 25, and he both corrected and slightly revised his text on NAR 25pf. Those revisions are adopted here, except where they seem
      designed to shorten, soften, or otherwise adapt the text for the NAR editors and audience. Because this speech is a work of great
      interest, we have treated it as a special instance and reported all the variants in the MS and the Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcript,</hi> in addition to those in TS2, TS4, NAR 25pf, and NAR 25.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens added to TS2 several notes to the editors and typesetters at the NAR, suggesting that the Whittier
      dinner be the first part of the installment, followed by the “$3-Dog” story from the AD of 3 October 1907—as NAR
      25 was ultimately published.</p>

      TS1—which contain unflattering remarks about Charles Dudley Warner and Charles E. Perkins—to signal temporary
      suppression. In addition, he twice substituted ‘Nevermindwho’ for Perkins’s name, and used the same expression in
      two insertions—revisions that were not incorporated into TS2, which suggests that Hobby was instructed to disregard them.
      Clemens at first rejected this dictation for publication, noting on TS2 that none of it was ‘printable while I am
      alive’. In January 1907, however, he returned to it, assisted by Paine, when additional installments for the NAR were needed.
      Paine suggested an excerpt from the first part of the text, but questioned the suitability of the second part, writing queries in the
      margins and bracketing several passages to suggest omission. Clemens then revised TS2, but stopped after the first passage that Paine
      had queried (which was also circled in blue on TS1, at 271.3–5). The rest of the text was canceled in pencil. Hobby copied the
      selected portion of the text in TS3, which include excerpts about Clemens’s dream of his brother Henry from the ADs of 13
      January and 15 January 1906. Clemens revised TS3 further to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 16 (see Contents and Pagination of
      TS3, Batch 4). Collation reveals a substantive change between TS3 and NAR 16 that is deemed an authorial revision on the lost NAR
      16pf: ‘smoked’ was altered to ‘bought’ (at 269.19); the NAR reading has been adopted here.
      Clemens’s notes on TS2 and TS3 indicate his general dissatisfaction with the material.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens circled two references to Charles E. Perkins in blue pencil on TS1 to suggest temporary suppression. Paine
      reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR; he then marked and queried the first few pages and deleted them, suggesting that the
      excerpt begin at ‘I do’ (4.1). In addition, he bracketed several passages to suggest omission; the one that fell within
      the chosen extract was deleted in pencil. Clemens made only two marks on TS2 before Hobby retyped it to create TS3, which comprises a
      catena of excerpts from the ADs of 12 January, 13 January, and 15 January 1906 (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 4). Clemens
      revised TS3 to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 16. Collation reveals no clear evidence of authorial revision on the lost NAR
      16pf. There is one substantive change between TS3 and NAR 16—‘that’ altered to ‘the’ (at
      4.20)—which has been rejected as editorial interference or compositorial error.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The (nearly) two pages missing from TS1 were discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> He preserved three lines from the bottom of page 124, which he pasted to the
      bottom of page 122, partially covering up three lines of text, which are nevertheless still legible. Hobby incorporated the revisions
      that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, and they were incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has no authority for the text that survives in
      TS1. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was collated and its one variant reported, because TS2 and TS4 derive independently from TS1
      and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the other. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they confirm the readings of
      the missing portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens revised TS2, in both ink and blue pencil, and selected an excerpt for publication in the NAR; there is
      no indication that Paine assisted him. The excerpt was cut away and sent to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 14, which also
      comprises the entire AD of 6 Dec 1906 and excerpts from the ADs of 17 Dec 1906, 11 Feb 1907, and 12 Feb 1907. His suppression of
      Twichell’s name, for which he substituted ‘Harris’, has been rejected here. The last sentence in the excerpt
      (‘Nothing so fortunate ever happened to Joe as that.’) was omitted from NAR 14. Although it is possible that Clemens
      deleted it on the lost NAR 14pf, it seems more likely that an NAR editor removed it to make the text fit on the last page of the
      installment; it has therefore been retained here. Other variants in NAR 14 suggest that Clemens made two substantive revisions. The
      first of these, the change from ‘begattings’ to ‘Begats’ (290.1), has been adopted. The second, the
      substitution of ‘uncle’s’ for ‘wife’s’ (290.5), has been rejected as a revision intended

<p rend="noindent">Most of page 149 of TS1 was discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>. He preserved only three lines from the top of the page, pasting them to the bottom
      of page 148. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, and they were incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has
      no authority for the text that survives in TS1 or MS. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was collated, because TS2 and TS4 derive
      independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the other. TS2 and TS4 agree, confirming
      the readings of the missing portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Paine reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR, deleting the marginal date ‘1864’ and
      adding a query about spacing the text transcribed from the MS in the second part. Clemens revised TS2, restoring the date and noting
      that the MS text could be set as regular text or as an extract. (This was the first NAR installment to print such a marginal date.)
      The dictation was divided into two installments: NAR 8 and NAR 22; page 289 of TS2 was cut in two, and only the top piece was
      submitted for NAR 8. Harvey wrote ‘9th instalment’ at the top after the TS2 printer’s copy was received at the
      NAR. The installment later became NAR 8 when the selections previously scheduled for that installment were postponed until NAR 12 (see
      the Textual Commentary for “John Hay”). When NAR 8 was in galley proofs, on 10 December 1906, David Munro wrote to
      Clemens, who was in Washington on copyright business:</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p rend="text-indent:2">I am in distress over one of the first four pages of the new instalment of the
      Autobiography, and the printer expects me to send them to the press tomorrow. That is why I pursue you to Washington.</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">On page 1218, Joe Goodman challenges Tom Fitch to duel and “modifies” him.</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">On page 1219, we expect the Major to stand Joe up against Tom Fitch. But Joe is stood up with Steve Gillis and
      “modifies” Steve. What I would know at this last moment is if that is a slip of the pen. If it is, will you do me the
      great kindness to telegraph me at our expense in the words “Change the names,” which I shall consider as authorization
      to substitute Tom Fitch for Steve Gillis and Tom for Steve in the description of the duel.</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">If it is all
      right as it stands, please telegraph me the words “Let it stand.”</p> <p rend="text-indent:2">I am, no doubt, stupid in
      making this inquiry, but, honor bright, stupidity is one of the prime qualifications of an editor, for he represents the stupidity of
      the people. (Munro to SLC, <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>)</p></quote>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Clemens drafted a response on the verso of Munro’s letter: “Make page twelve-twenty read
      ‘Joe tumbled Fitch down next morning with a bullet’ etc.” Munro adopted Clemens’s revised text in NAR 8,
      but it has been rejected here as an unnecessary refinement that the author did not initiate (see the entry for ‘his man
      down’ at 296.2).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The second part of this dictation, based largely on an MS written in Vienna in 1898, was not published until
      September 1907, in NAR 22, where it was combined with excerpts from the ADs of 10 October and 20 Dec 1906. The MS was written in black
      ink on torn half sheets of heavy cream-colored wove paper, measuring 5⅝ by 8⅞ inches. The readings of the unidentified
      clipping that Hobby transcribed with the MS are adopted, and the accidental variants she introduced in TS2 are not reported. Clemens
      made his last revisions on the TS2 printer’s copy in May 1907: on the last page he canceled a typed note—‘(Here
      insert—and translate—the German article about Cavalotti’s duels. Pinned to first copy of this
      autobiography.)’—and appended a paragraph in his own hand about the Italian duelist Cavallotti, dating it 13 May 1907.
      At one time, however, Clemens had apparently planned to pair the second part of this dictation with an excerpt from the AD of 9
      January 1906. On the last page of TS2 of the earlier dictation he wrote the fictitious dateline ‘<hi rend="italic">Dictated
      March</hi> 12, 1906’ (see the Textual Commentary for AD, 9 Jan 1906). He sent that page to the NAR with the bottom piece of
      page 289 of the present dictation, and the fictitious dateline was adopted in NAR 22. Collation reveals a substantive change between
      TS2 and NAR 22 that is deemed an authorial revision on the lost NAR 22pf: ‘deadly’ was altered to ‘fatal’
      (at 302.14); the NAR reading has been adopted here.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The pages missing from TS1 were discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, and they were
      incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has no authority for the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was collated
      and its variants reported, because TS2 and TS4 derive independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings
      not present in the other. When TS2 and TS4 agree, they confirm the readings of the missing portion of TS1. One of the readings in TS4
      has been adopted (see the entry for ‘Trafalgar,’ at 311.10).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Hobby typed into TS1 the instruction ‘(Here insert the newspaper account of the meeting at Carnegie (of
      Jan. 22nd). The future editor of this biography can use what he chooses of it, or leave it out)’. The clipping is unmarked save
      for the date ‘Jan 22 1906’ in the top margin (possibly written by Hobby) and the deletion of the text that follows
      Clemens’s speech. It is frayed at one edge and is missing a few characters, which have been supplied from another copy. Hobby
      transcribed the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> clipping into TS2; the readings of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> are adopted, and the
      accidental variants she introduced in TS2 are not reported. (The clipping was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> transcribed into TS4, which
      merely appended the note ‘[See original MS.]’ to the instruction to ‘insert the newspaper account’.) NAR
      proofs of the speech survive with the typescripts; their purpose has not been discovered.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> The missing TS1 pages might have shed some light on a peculiar element of the TS2 and TS4 texts: both
      typescripts include a 31 January 1906 thank-you letter from Laura K. Hudson without explanation or preamble, following the paragraph
      that ends at ‘let it stay.’ (310.36). (Hudson thanked Clemens for having sent her the text of his 1877 speech at the
      Whittier Birthday Dinner; see the Textual Commentary <!--xref-->for AD, <ref corresp="#ts0040" type="chapterref">11 January
      1906</ref>.) The original letter has not been found, nor is it transcribed in TS1. Hudson’s letter, presumably received around
      1 February, must have been attached to or interleaved with the TS1 pages at the time that TS2 and TS4 were typed, sometime after
      Clemens revised TS1 on 25 May, the date of his inserted footnote (310 <hi rend="italic">ftnt</hi>). It is conceivable that some
      instruction from Clemens was written on the letter itself or on the now-missing TS1 pages, but it seems more likely that the letter
      was only accidentally incorporated into the dictation. It has not been included in the present text, although it can be found as a
      rejected reading in the apparatus (see the entry for ‘stay.’ at 310.35).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> The source of Clemens’s essay “The Character of Man” is an MS originally written in 1884
      or 1885. Like the text of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> clipping, the essay is represented in TS1 only by a typed instruction
      ‘(Put old MS. here).’ The MS was written in ink that had faded to gray on cream-colored laid paper with a
      “Keystone Linen” watermark, measuring 5½ by 8⅞ inches. It consists of two pieces that Clemens culled and
      conflated. The first piece is numbered 1–7, the second is numbered [1]–4, 7–20. The first page of the second
      piece originally contained the title ‘Accepted Lies’; When Clemens revised the essay he evidently discarded pages 5 and
      6, adding asterisks at the top of page 7 to signal the omission (see the entries for ‘* * * * There’ at 313.1 and
      ‘procession. <corr>¶</corr> * * * * Consider’ at 313.26). He made a number of revisions in the original gray ink
      when he first wrote the manuscript. He made the next round of revisions (undated) in pencil, and the last one (in January 1906, as
      attested by the two added footnotes) in black ink, as well as in an ink that now closely resembles that of the original inscription.
      All of the black ink revisions appear to date from 1906, and they clearly followed those in pencil; they are in a hand that is
      noticeably different from that of 1884 or 1885. It is not possible, however, to assign all the revisions to a particular stage: the
      first of the two added footnotes, for example, is in black ink, while the second one is in a lighter ink that closely resembles the
      ink of the original inscription.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Paine reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR and suggested a brief excerpt; Clemens decided that
      none of it was ‘usable’.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR and selected two excerpts. Hobby incorporated
      the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both TS2 (which was not further revised) and TS3. The ribbon copy of TS3 is lost, but the
      carbon survives (its typed page numbers were altered by hand to 4–9). TS3 carbon comprises a total of twenty-seven pages, a
      catena of excerpts from the ADs of 1 February, 2 February, and 5 February 1906 (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch
      2<!--xref-->). Harvey carried away TS3 ribbon, from which NAR 3pf was typeset, while TS3 carbon remained with Clemens, who belatedly
      revised it. At that time, the three February excerpts were scheduled to lead off the series of autobiography “Chapters”
      in NAR 1, and in TS3 they were preceded by an introduction taken from the AD of 26 March 1906. Ultimately, however, they were
      postponed to NAR 3, and the introduction was moved to NAR 1, which comprises the first part of “My Autobiography [Random
      Extracts from It].” Clemens retained TS3 carbon (consisting of the introductory passage from the AD of 26 March and the three
      February excerpts), which he revised after TS3 ribbon had been prepared and conveyed to the NAR, adding a note to Harvey on the first
      page:</p>
<quote rend="blockquote"><p rend="noindent"> <hi rend="italic">Dublin, Sunday.</hi> Dear Harvey: I have corrected this September
      instalment. Please transfer the corrections to your duplicate, then send <hi rend="italic">this</hi> one to <hi rend="italic">“Miss Clara Clemens, Norfolk, Conn.”</hi> I think she will add no corrections, but it is best to send it anyway; for
      she is naturally violent, &amp; if you ever print one of these without letting her give it the seal of her final supervision
      &amp; authority, somebody’s scalp will disappear—probably yours. Do this, &amp; oblige </p> <p rend="text-indent:17">Your uncle</p> <p rend="text-indent:19">Mark.</p> </quote>
<p rend="noindent">Clemens made four revisions (and two corrections) in the 1 February material on TS3 carbon, but it arrived at the
      NAR too late for them to be incorporated into NAR 3pf. All of them are adopted in the present edition. When Clemens read NAR 3pf, he
      tried to recreate the changes on TS3 carbon from memory, but managed to recapture only two of his original four revisions, and only
      one of those exactly; he also made one new revision. He may have made a few revisions on the lost TS3 ribbon as well, but collation
      reveals no substantive variants between it and NAR 3, and the alterations in punctuation and spelling—as well as two changes
      from plural to singular verbs (see the entries for ‘invite’, ‘worship’, and ‘command’ at
      321.3)—have been rejected as editorial interference.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The installment in NAR 3pf was at first entitled ‘Chapter from My Autobiography.—I.’ and
      began with the introductory text from AD, 26 March 1906. By the time it was actually published, however, the ‘I’ had
      been modified to ‘III’ and the introduction had been removed (‘Chapter’ had also been corrected to
      ‘Chapters’).</p>

<p rend="noindent">Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR and selected one excerpt. Hobby incorporated
      the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both TS2 (which was not further revised) and TS3. The ribbon copy of TS3 is lost, but the
      carbon survives but the carbon survives (its typed page numbers were altered by hand to 10–20, with one leaf left unnumbered
      between 19 and 20). TS3 carbon comprises a total of twenty-seven pages, a catena of excerpts from the ADs of 1 February, 2 February,
      and 5 February 1906 (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 2<!--xref-->). Harvey carried away TS3 ribbon, from which NAR 3pf was
      typeset, while TS3 carbon remained with Clemens, who belatedly revised it. He made three revisions in the 2 February material and sent
      it off to the NAR, but it arrived too late for its revisions to be incorporated into NAR 3pf. All of them are adopted in the present
      edition. He reinscribed one of them, the addition of an underscore, when he read NAR 3pf. Clemens may have made a few revisions on the
      lost TS3 ribbon as well, but collation reveals no substantive variants between it and NAR 3, and the alterations in punctuation and
      spelling have been rejected as editorial interference.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">In this dictation, Clemens began to draw on his already composed manuscript memorial to his daughter Susy. He
      had begun to write a memorial for private distribution immediately upon her death in 1896; by 1902 it had reached relative completion
      as a manuscript entitled “In Memory of Olivia Susan Clemens, 1872–1896.” Twenty-two leaves of this manuscript
      were in the Estelle Doheny Collection at St. John’s Seminary in Camarillo, California, until sold in 1989. Four further leaves
      (22–25) were repurposed by Clemens as part of his manuscript “Notes to Susy’s Biography,” in <ref corresp="bib10492" type="dbquery">ViU</ref>. There are other manuscripts and typescripts relating to the memorial in <ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>, which Clemens was still adding to as late as 1906.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Collation reveals that the manuscript materials were not transcribed directly into TS1: the numerous
      substantive changes and expansions between the written materials and the dictation typescript can only be the result of authorial
      revision. For example, the manuscript reading ‘hindered, baffled’ became ‘hampered’ in TS1;
      ‘mid-ocean’ became ‘mid-Atlantic’; ‘lights’ became ‘lights as she had waved her
      farewell to us thirteen months before’; and ‘which broke my heart when I read it’ became ‘which needs no
      comment’ (324.15, 324.18, 324.27). The TS1 variants in spelling, however, provide evidence that Hobby did not directly
      transcribe an <hi rend="italic">intervening</hi> document that Clemens revised: the medium of transmission must have been oral/aural.
      For example, Clemens’s manuscript spelling ‘Susy’ consistently became ‘Susie’ in TS1. And the
      phrase ‘glories, bloom, and song’, quoted from William Wilfred Campbell’s poem “Love,” correctly
      transcribed in Clemens’s manuscript, was rendered by Hobby as ‘glories’ bloom and sun’ (this phrase and
      one other substantive error in TS1’s version of the poem have been emended in the present text: see 325.19 and the entry for
      ‘even’ at 325.22). In addition, the manuscript’s use of italics for emphasis is not reflected in TS1, which
      italicized different words, presumably on the basis of Clemens’s oral delivery. Everything points to Clemens’s
      “cannibalizing” the Susy memorial for his autobiography, dictating to Hobby with his manuscript (or a revision of it)
      before him, and altering the wording as he went along. This deduction is confirmed by the wording of Clemens’s notation on a
      page of the Susy memorial materials: ‘this was dictated &amp; is no longer required’ (“Notes to Susy’s
      Biography,” p. 22, <ref corresp="bib10492" type="dbquery">ViU</ref>); the text in question appears in the AD of 7 February
      1906. In accordance with our general policy of relying on the version of the text that is closest to what Clemens provided to Hobby
      (which, in this case, is his oral reworking of the material), TS1 is adopted as the primary source, and the readings of the various
      related manuscripts have not been reported.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">At the top of TS1 Clemens wrote a reference to his poem “Broken Idols,” written on 18 August 1898
      (the two-year anniversary of Susy Clemens’s death) and revised as “In Dim and Fitful Visions” on 18 August 1902.
      The distraught mother in the poem recalls her lost daughter at four stages of life and imagines that she has lost four daughters.
      Clemens never acted on his reminder about the poem.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi>—use it’ on the first page of TS1 (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29). Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR and selected two
      excerpts. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both TS2 (which was not further revised) and TS3. The ribbon
      copy of TS3 is lost, but the carbon survives (its typed page numbers were altered by hand to 22–29). TS3 carbon comprises a
      total of twenty-seven pages, a catena of excerpts from the ADs of 1 February, 2 February, and 5 February 1906 (see Contents and
      Pagination of TS3, Batch 2<!--xref-->). Harvey carried away TS3 ribbon, from which NAR 3pf was typeset, while TS3 carbon remained with
      Clemens, who belatedly revised it. He made ten changes to the 5 February material (including the correction of a typographical error)
      and sent it off to the NAR, but it arrived too late for its revisions to be incorporated into NAR 3pf. All of them are adopted in the
      present edition. Clemens may have made a few revisions on the lost TS3 ribbon as well, but collation reveals no substantive variants
      between it and NAR 3, and the alterations in punctuation and spelling have been rejected as editorial interference. Clemens made no
      revisions on these excerpts in NAR 3pf.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Clemens added a note to the first page of TS3 carbon, instructing Harvey to send it on to Clara Clemens for
      approval (see the Textual Commentary for AD, 1 Feb 1906). Clara communicated one revision to Munro at the NAR: ‘I have marked a
      sentence on the sheet enclosed here which you can perhaps alter in some way’ (CC to Munro, 25? Aug 1906, <ref corresp="bib21700" type="dbquery">WU</ref>). The ‘sheet enclosed’ was evidently page 21 of TS3 carbon, now missing,
      which contained the beginning of the 5 February excerpt. At Clara’s request Munro revised a phrase about Quarry Farm on NAR
      3pf; its location had already been explained in the excerpt from the AD of 2 February 1906, earlier in the installment.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘M C’ in blue pencil on the first page of TS1; that notation was later partially erased (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29). Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR
      and selected two excerpts. He deleted two marginal dates and also suggested a revision, the addition of Susy’s age in 1885:
      ‘and she in the fourteenth of hers’ (see the entry for ‘age.’ at 339.5). Hobby had already incorporated
      the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2 (which he did not further revise), so Harvey’s suggestions were not included in
      TS2. When Hobby prepared TS3, however, she followed Harvey’s revisions, but queried his insertion. Clemens revised TS3 to serve
      as printer’s copy for NAR 4, where it is followed by the AD of 8 February 1906 (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 3).
      He responded to Hobby’s query by supplying new wording, which has not been adopted here, however, because he did not initiate
      the change.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The 7 February dictation is the first of many in which Clemens interpolates extracts from Susy Clemens’s
      unfinished biography of him. Susy started the biography in early 1885, when she was thirteen years old; the last entry is from July
      1886. Her manuscript written in a childish hand and dotted with misspellings, was later annotated by her father (MS at <ref corresp="bib10492" type="dbquery">ViU</ref>). As with the manuscript material from Clemens’s memorial to Susy, it is clear that
      Clemens dictated the biography material to Hobby: the manuscript’s punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing, and emphasis are
      only rarely reflected in TS1—to a degree compatible with Clemens deliberately retaining certain quaint spellings, presumably
      spelling them out for his amanuensis, but not compatible with direct transcription.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘M C (use it)’ in blue pencil on the first page of TS1; that notation was later partially erased (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29). Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR
      and selected the entire dictation. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both TS2 (which was not further
      revised) and TS3. Clemens revised TS3 to serve as printer’s copy for the second section of NAR 4, where it follows excerpts
      from the AD of 7 February 1906 (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batch 3). Several of Clemens’s revisions on TS3 have not
      been adopted here, since they were clearly intended to soften the language for magazine publication. On TS1 he circled, in blue
      pencil, two occurrences of Susy Warner’s name; on TS3 he suppressed her name and first substituted ‘Tabitha
      Wilson’, and then ‘your wife’ and ‘that lady’ (see the entries for ‘Susy Warner’ at
      346.4–5 and 346.9). Elsewhere, he altered ‘thieves’ to ‘buccaneers’ and deleted ‘Soapy
      Sall’ (see the entries at 342.33 and 345.34). On the first page of TS3, someone, presumably in an effort to understand the
      anecdote at 342.38–343.30, sketched the “spoon-shaped drive.”</p>

<p rend="noindent">On TS1, after the reference to the sinking of the clipper ship <hi rend="italic">Hornet,</hi> Clemens added the
      instruction ‘Insert, here my account of the “Hornet” disaster, published in the “Century” about
      1898 as being a chapter from my Autobiography’; Hobby typed the instruction into TS2, where Clemens deleted it. The reference
      is to the article “My Debut as a Literary Person,” included in “<ref corresp="#d1e3892" type="chapterref">Preliminary Manuscripts and Dictations</ref>.” That instruction, however, is of questionable practicality. Clemens never
      adjusted the text of the dictation to fit the proposed insertion of the article; and for such a long digression to follow
      Clemens’s words ‘I will go no further with the subject now’ (369.13–14) would be excessively awkward.
      Likewise, his claim that he has ‘already told the rest in some book of mine’ obviously assumes the <hi rend="italic">omission</hi> of the article. Hobby transcribed the unidentified newspaper clipping into TS2; the readings of the clipping are
      adopted, and the accidental variants she introduced in TS2 are not reported. She incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1
      into TS2, which he further revised for possible publication in the NAR, but it never appeared there.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘Mc’ in blue pencil, and then deleting it, on the first page of TS1; that notation was later partially erased
      (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29). One revision in black ink on TS1 is in Paine’s
      hand: the insertion of ‘A year or two later’ (see the entry at 10.19). Since this revision was incorporated into TS2, it
      must date from 1906, but is not adopted here. Harvey reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR and selected two excerpts.
      Clemens revised TS2 to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 7, where it is followed by excerpts from the ADs of 6 March and 23 March
      1906. The top of page 539 was cut away and sent to the NAR with pages 546–47; Clemens retained the intervening pages.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The page missing from TS1 was discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, and they were
      incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has no authority for the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was
      collated, because TS2 and TS4 derive independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the
      other. They contain no variants, confirming the readings of the missing portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Hobby’s source for Clemens’s letter to Grover Cleveland was almost certainly his fair copy of
      the <ref target="/http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/search?keyword=UCCL07365;style=mtp;brand=default;sort=date;category=letters" type="url">original letter</ref>, now in the Berg Collection in the New York Public Library. It contains one substantive variant from
      TS1 (‘public man’ instead of ‘man’ at 5.12), which has been adopted here. The fair copy omits the
      letterhead, date, salutation, and complimentary close (‘With the profoundest respect’) of the original letter, which is
      in the Library of Congress (DLC).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">Harvey reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR and selected three excerpts. Clemens revised TS2 to
      serve as printer’s copy for NAR 7, where it is combined with excerpts from the ADs of 5 March and 23 March 1906. TS2 was cut
      into several pieces, and only the text to be typeset was sent to the NAR. The second excerpt (‘In accordance . . .
      March 18/06.’) was cut out from the middle of page 552 and placed third of the three excerpts in the installment. An NAR editor
      renumbered the pages of the printer’s copy to assist the typesetters. Clemens retained the remaining pieces, writing
      ‘Some of this had been used’ on them. As a result, his words are discontinuous now that TS2 has been reassembled in its
      original order.</p>

<p rend="noindent"> The (nearly) two pages missing from TS1 were discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>. He preserved three lines from the bottom of page 421, which he pasted to the
      bottom of page 419, partially covering up some of the text, which is nevertheless still legible. Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906
      for possible publication in the NAR and selected the entire dictation. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into
      both TS3 and TS4. (The pages of TS2 that must have contained this dictation, 558–66, are now lost.) TS4 has no authority for
      the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was collated and its variants reported, because TS3 and TS4 derive
      independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the other. When TS3 and TS4 agree, they
      confirm the readings of the missing portion of TS1. TS4 includes a phrase that is lacking in TS3: ‘and some devil’s
      inspiration reminded me of yesterday’ (393.22). The omission of this phrase from TS3 is deemed an error, and the TS4 reading is
      adopted here. Clemens revised TS3 to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 6, where it appears between excerpts from the ADs of 26
      February and 22 March 1906.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The partial page missing from TS1 was discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> He cut away the dateline and summary paragraph and pasted them to the top of page
      431, partially covering the text, which is nevertheless still legible. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into

<p rend="text-indent:2">The clipping of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> that Hobby transcribed into TS1 does not survive. The source

      Library’; the obscured letters have been supplied by TS1 and TS2. The readings of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> are adopted,
      and the accidental variants Hobby introduced in TS1 are not reported. One ink revision on TS1 is in Paine’s hand: the
      alteration of ‘he’ to ‘the real Injun Joe’ (397.38). Since this revision was incorporated into TS2, it
      must date from 1906, but is not adopted here.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> When Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR, he selected an excerpt to begin

      marked an excerpt to begin at the same place, but deleted the article copied from the Los Angeles <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>. TS2
      served as printer’s copy for NAR 21, where it appears between an excerpt from the AD of 8 November 1906 and the entire AD of 6
      January 1907. Clemens made no revisions in these excerpts on NAR 21pf.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, which he further revised. On the first page of
      TS2 Clemens wrote, ‘Not usable yet’. Although TS1 ends with ‘the nose.’ on page 459, it is clear that
      Clemens intended the next two pages, beginning with ‘The closing heading’ (406.20), to be appended to the present
      dictation, despite the fact that their content was actually dictated on 14 March. In TS1 and TS2, the pages that begin with
      ‘The closing heading’ include the time and word count with which Hobby typically began each dictation. In addition, in
      TS2 the two dictations run together without the usual page break, and in TS4 (also made from the revised TS1), the text continues
      through ‘a scratch.’ (407.4), the end adopted here.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2">The telegram from President Roosevelt to General Wood (405.13–17) was printed in several newspapers,
      including the New York <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> with only minor variants in the text (“Special to the New York
      Times,” 11 Mar 1906, 1). Since Hobby’s exact source cannot be identified, however, the TS1 text is followed here.</p>

<p rend="noindent">The page missing from TS1 was discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>.</hi> TS4 has no authority for the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is missing,
      however, TS4 was collated, because TS2 and TS4 derive independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings
      not present in the other. TS2 and TS4 agree, confirming the readings of the missing portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> The <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> 1 clipping is pasted to a leaf inserted into TS1 numbered 472a. In TS2 the
      text of the article was typed above the dateline and summary paragraph (the article was not transcribed in TS4). The present text
      begins with the dateline and summary, followed by the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> article. The readings of <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> 1 are adopted, and the accidental variants that Hobby introduced in TS2 are not reported. The second clipping that Hobby
      transcribed in TS2—the original of <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> 2—is not extant, although it is part of the same article
      as the first (unlike the first clipping, it was transcribed in TS4). The source here is therefore a microfilm of the newspaper. Four
      of the variants in TS1, detected by collation, are adopted; they are deemed to be Clemens’s revisions on the lost <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> clipping or necessary corrections. All variants between <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> 2 and TS1 are
      reported.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2, whose last three pages he further revised
      before writing ‘Not usable yet’ at the top. His original intention was to pair the material on these pages, about the
      barking dog (beginning at ‘Fifteen or twenty years ago’ [416.20]), with the Florentine dictation “John
      Hay,” to make an NAR installment. He cut away the relevant pages and sent them to the NAR, where someone (probably Harvey)
      wrote ‘Jno Hay’ on the verso of the last page. None of the dictation was ever published, however, and “John
      Hay” was paired with excerpts from the ADs of 5 Apr and 6 Apr 1906 in NAR 12.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> This dictation was made on 15 March 1906; its dateline, ‘Monday, March 5, 1906’, reflects the
      date of the events under discussion, which were reported in the newspapers of 5 March. This edition could have presented the dictation
      under its “putative” date, rather than its real date of dictation, but as there already is an AD of 5 March 1906, this
      would have resulted in confusion.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘M C’ in ink on the first page of TS1. Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into TS2. Paine
      reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR, marking a passage about Tom Sawyer’s cave for possible omission. Clemens
      selected the entire dictation and revised TS2 to serve as printer’s copy for NAR 23. He canceled Paine’s marks in ink
      and retained the queried text, but deleted a sentence about Jimmy McDaniel’s teeth, noting in the margin that he was
      ‘still alive’ (see the entry for ‘Still . . . town’ at 417.38–418.1). In NAR 23 the
      dictation is combined with excerpts from the ADs of 9 March 1906, 26 July 1907, and 30 July 1907. Collation reveals no evidence of
      authorial revision on the lost NAR 23pf.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens considered this dictation for possible publication through Samuel McClure’s newspaper syndicate,
      writing ‘M<hi rend="superscript">c</hi> (only about farewell lecture)’ on the first page of TS1; the note was later
      deleted in blue pencil (see the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref>, p. 29). The TS1 text of SLC to Foote is
      on pages numbered [1]–6 and inserted after page 503. The TS1 text of the MS is on six pages that Clemens renumbered
      508–13 over typed numbers [1]–6. The letter to Foote is a draft; it is not known whether any letter was actually sent,
      either to Foote or to the younger Rockefeller, as Clemens claims (‘I sent that letter privately to young John himself’
      at 425.20). Hobby transcribed the text of SLC to Foote, with its attached clippings from the <hi rend="italic">Times,</hi> into TS1,
      which Clemens revised. The readings of the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> are adopted, and the accidental variants she introduced in TS2
      are not reported. The TS1 text of the correspondence about the Fulton Memorial includes two consistent word variations from the MS:
      ‘Memorial’ was substituted for “Monument’ (426.29, 426.33, 426.39), and ‘Headquarters Department of
      the East, | Governors Island, New York.’ was substituted for ‘Army Headquarters.’ (426.25–26,
      426.36–37, 427.7 [‘Headquarters . . . East’ only]). It is unlikely that Clemens revised a lost document
      that intervened between the MS and TS1, since these minor changes would hardly have required the retyping of the the entire
      correspondence. Presumably, these corrections—adopted here—were communicated orally to Hobby before she transcribed the
      MS. The text on the ninth MS page is missing from TS1; the ninth and tenth pages of the MS (the last two) were not numbered, and the
      omission is deemed Hobby’s oversight; the text is therefore included here (see the entry for ‘<hi rend="italic">Mem</hi>
      . . . SLC’ at 428.12–18).</p>

      is on pages with typed numbers 531–36, replacing the original typed numbers 3–6 and 10–11. Clemens used only
      Olivia’s portion of the 22 June 1876 letter; at the top of TS1 page 531, some of his own portion of the letter, which preceded
      hers, is visible. The manuscripts of the letters are extant; although the Scottish typescripts were not exact transcriptions of the
      manuscripts (the punctuation had been altered, especially Olivia’s idiosyncratic style), they were Hobby’s only source,
      and their readings have therefore been retained here. The manuscript of the 25–28 October 1875 letter, however, includes a
      sentence not found in TS1 (‘Could not your son bring you?’ at 434.36–37). The sentence is in the text published
      in <hi rend="italic">Letters of Dr. John Brown</hi> (<ref corresp="bib00074" type="dbquery">John Brown 1907</ref>), whose source was
      almost certainly the same typescript that Jock Brown sent to Clemens and asked to be returned to him. Since there is no apparent
      reason for Clemens to delete the sentence, it seems likely that Hobby omitted it in error, and it has been restored here. (The
      manuscript of the <ref target="letters/UCCL01343.xml" type="crossref">22 June 1876</ref> letter was sold at Sotheby’s in 1993;
      its present location is unknown; see <hi rend="italic">MTPO</hi> for a transcription. The second and third letters, of <ref target="letters/UCCL01279.xml" type="crossref">25–28 October 1875</ref> and 1 June 1882<!--UCCL02212-->, are in the National
      Library of Scotland in Edinburgh (<ref corresp="bib13232" type="dbquery">StEdNL</ref>; see <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00010" type="dbquery">L6</ref>,</hi> 570–71, for a transcription of the 1875 letter.)</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> The dateline typed on TS1 (‘Friday, March 22.’) is erroneous and has been corrected in the
      present text. Harvey reviewed TS1 in August 1906 for possible publication in the NAR and selected one excerpt. Hobby incorporated the
      revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both TS2 (which was not further revised) and TS3, where she ended the summary paragraph with
      ‘Houghton’s.’ to correspond to the material included there. Clemens revised TS3 to serve as printer’s copy
      for NAR 6, where it follows excerpts from the AD of 26 February 1906 and the entire AD of 7 March 1906. He made no revisions in this
      excerpt on NAR 6pf.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> On the verso of the last page of TS3 Harvey wrote the following draft: ‘We may conclude generally that
      “early to bed, early to rise” continues to produce the beneficial effects accorded by tradition to the habit and that
      less turning of night into day would add materially to the sum of human happiness’. This sentence appeared in the
      “Editor’s Chair” in the NAR issue of 5 October 1906 (183:692).</p>

<p rend="noindent">The pages missing from TS1 were discarded by Paine when he edited the dictation for <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref></hi>. He preserved seven lines from the top of page 546, pasting them to the bottom of
      page 545. The revisions that Clemens made on TS1 were incorporated into TS2, and they were incorporated into TS4 as well. TS4 has no
      authority for the text that survives in TS1. Where TS1 is missing, however, TS4 was collated and its variant reported, because TS2 and
      TS4 derive independently from TS1 and therefore either may incorporate authorial readings not present in the other. When TS2 and TS4
      agree, they confirm the readings of the missing portion of TS1.</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Harvey reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR and selected an excerpt. Clemens revised TS2 to serves
      as printer’s copy for NAR 7, where it follows excerpts from the ADs of 5 March and 6 March 1906. The bottom of page 686 was cut
      away, and sent with the last two pages (687–88); an NAR editor renumbered the pages to place them in sequence after the earlier
      excerpts. Clemens made no revisions in this excerpt on NAR 7pf.</p>

<p rend="noindent">TS1 is complete, but Paine, when editing <hi rend="italic"><ref corresp="bib00116" type="dbquery">MTA</ref>,</hi>
      cut up the first two pages and set aside the material about Rockefeller (both the clipping and the comments that follow), writing that
      it was ‘not to be used for fifty years’. The original order of the material, confirmed by TS4, is retained here. (The
      pages of TS2 that must have contained this dictation, 689–705, are now lost.) The wording of the unidentified clipping suggests
      that it was from an Elmira newspaper rather than one from Des Moines as Clemens states (‘This clipping from a Des Moines, Iowa,
      newspaper’ at 444.1). None of the clippings was revised by Clemens, and the accidental variants introduced by Hobby in TS2 are
      not reported. The letter from Higbie and its enclosure have been faithfully reproduced from the original manuscript, as Clemens
      expressly wished (‘I shall allow myself the privilege of copying his punctuation and his spelling’ at 445.15). Harvey
      and Clemens both reviewed the dictation in August 1906 to select an excerpt for publication in the NAR. Clemens apparently considered
      including the text through the discussion of ‘The Swangos’, but Harvey limited the excerpt to five paragraphs in the
      middle, which he chose to serve as an introduction to the first NAR installment of “Chapters from My Autobiography,”
      whose contents were altered twice. First, the introduction was paired with text that was ultimately published in NAR 2, then it was
      moved to precede text that became NAR 3, before it finally appeared in NAR 1, with the first part of “My Autobiography [Random
      Extracts from It]” (see Contents and Pagination of TS3, Batches 1 and 2<!--xref-->, and the Textual Commentary for AD, 1
      February 1906).</p>
<p rend="text-indent:2"> Hobby incorporated the revisions that Clemens made on TS1 into both a ribbon and carbon copy of TS3. Clemens
      retained TS3 carbon, which he revised after TS3 ribbon had been prepared and conveyed to the NAR, adding a note to Harvey about his
      revisions (quoted in full in the Textual Commentary for AD, 1 February 1906). He made only one revision in the introduction on TS3
      carbon, altering ‘Rockefeller’ to ‘multibillionaire’; his desire to suppress Rockefeller’s name in
      the NAR is not followed here. He made no revisions on NAR 1pf.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Hobby made an error in the TS1 pagination; Clemens corrected her redundant typed numbers (579–81) to the
      correct numbers (588–90). Hobby incorporated his revisions on TS1 into TS2. Paine reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the
      NAR, writing queries next to two passages. The first was Clemens’s description of his sister Pamela Moffett, which suggested
      that she was a lifelong hypochondriac (‘after . . . novelties.’ [at 451.31–34]); the second was the
      beginning of the anecdote about Orion’s bedroom adventure with ‘Dr. Meredith’s two ripe old-maid sisters’
      (‘Once . . . surprise.’ [at 453.17–19]). When Clemens revised TS2 to serve as printer’s copy for
      NAR 10, he softened the language in both instances. To his description of Pamela he added, ‘Her character was without blemish,
      and she was of a most kindly and gentle disposition.’ (451.34–35). This revision has been adopted in the present text on
      the assumption that it was not intended solely for magazine publication. When reading NAR 10pf he decided to delete the unflattering
      comments, which are, however, retained here. In the passage about Orion he made several revisions to tone down the
      language—revising the phrase quoted above, for example, to ‘Dr. G.’s two middle-aged maiden sisters’
      (453.22–23; see also the entries for ‘squirmed’ at 453.37 and ‘began to paw around, found
      Orion’s’ at 453.39–40). The last pages of TS2, now missing, were cut away when the typescript was sent to the
      NAR, where Harvey wrote on TS2 in blue pencil: he indicated that the ‘<hi rend="italic">10th</hi>’ excerpt should begin
      at the second paragraph and canceled one of Paine’s queries.</p>

<p rend="noindent">Clemens repaginated the first page of TS1, replacing the typed number 582 with 591; the remaining page numbers were
      corrected by Hobby to 592–611. Paine reviewed TS2 for possible publication in the NAR, querying three passages to suggest
      omission. Clemens revised TS2 in two stages—in ink before Paine read it, and then in blue pencil afterward. He suppressed
      personal names, and deleted all three passage that Paine had queried—revisions that have not been adopted here, since they were
      adaptations solely for publication in the NAR. TS2 served as printer’s copy for excerpts published in two NAR installments.
      Clemens originally selected a catena of excerpts from the ADs of 28 March, 29 March, and 2 April 1906 for NAR 10, and the galley
      proofs were typeset as a consecutive batch. Starting with the issue of 4 January 1907, however, the <hi rend="italic">North American
      Review</hi> had been shortened from 128 pages to 112. The autobiography installments, which generally ran between 10 and 14 pages, had
      to be shorter, and the proposed installment was split: the third excerpt from the present dictation was postponed to NAR 11, where it
      is followed by excerpts from the AD of 2 April.</p>
