They are not included in UC Press’s printed or electronic formats.</p>, '\n', <lb></lb>, '\n', <p rend="noindent">The general editorial policy of this critical edition is discussed in detail in the <ref corresp="#bm0017" type="chapterref">Note on the Text</ref>. This edition aims to present a text that reflects the author’s original inscription or
     dictation, altered by all subsequent authorial revisions that were not intended to shorten, soften, or otherwise adapt the text for
     magazine publication in the <hi rend="italic">North American Review</hi> (NAR) or other journals. All revisions that Clemens did not
     initiate, but made at the prompting of his editors, are likewise rejected. The individual Textual Commentaries supplement the general
     policy: they provide detailed descriptions of the source documents, report all the textual variants among them, and record the readings
     supplied by the editors. In addition, the Commentaries report all of Clemens’s revisions on manuscripts, as well as all
     corrections and revisions that he inscribed on typescripts and on galley proofs of NAR installments. The marks of Clemens’s
     contemporary collaborators on the source documents are likewise quoted in full (with the exceptions noted below), whereas the markings
     that Paine and DeVoto wrote on the typescripts after Clemens’s death are not transcribed.</p>, '\n', <p rend="text-indent:2">• <hi rend="italic">Source documents.</hi> All source documents are listed, including documents that were
     in the line of transmission of the texts but are now lost. <hi rend="italic">Unless otherwise noted, all original source documents are
     in the Mark Twain Papers (<ref corresp="bib10074" type="dbquery">CU-MARK</ref>).</hi> The typescripts of the 1906–9
     Autobiographical Dictations (<ref corresp="bib32977" type="dbquery">TS1</ref>, <ref corresp="bib32978" type="dbquery">TS2</ref>, <ref corresp="bib32979" type="dbquery">TS3</ref>, and <ref corresp="bib32980" type="dbquery">TS4</ref>) are described fully in the <ref corresp="#fr0011" type="chapterref">Introduction</ref> and, more concisely, in the <ref corresp="#bm0017" type="chapterref">Note on the
     Text</ref>; these descriptions are not repeated in the individual commentaries. The extent of each witness is defined by a reference to
     the edited text, consisting of cues with opening and closing words and their associated page-and-line numbering. If no text cue is
     listed, the witness encompasses the entire dictation. Following the list of source documents is a discussion of pertinent information
     about each piece—its history of composition, transmission, and revision, and, in some cases, preparation for magazine
     publication. In these discussions, the apparatus entries mentioned can be located by searching within the pop-up window in which the
     Textual Commentaries are displayed. For example, to find Clemens’s revisions on TS3, search “TS3-SLC.” If one or
     more of the source documents was revised for publication in the NAR, the marginal notes made by Clemens, Paine, Harvey, and Munro are
     reported in tabular form. Notes on the NAR printer’s copy such as <hi rend="smallcaps">“Mark Twain”</hi> and
     “<hi rend="italic">(To be Continued)</hi>”—which appeared at the end of nearly every installment—and
     miscellaneous notes made on the typescript versos are not listed in the table.</p>, '\n', <p rend="text-indent:2">• <hi rend="italic">Revisions, variants adopted or rejected, and textual notes.</hi></p>, '\n', <p rend="text-indent:2">Each entry on this list consists of the reading of the present text, separated by a bullet from the readings of
     the source document or documents on the right, each of which is identified by its sigil, as defined in <hi rend="italic">Source
     documents.</hi> All of the revisions on the source documents are reported, except for those that Paine and DeVoto made after
     Clemens’s death, when preparing their editions of the autobiography. Revisions are shown in plain text: inserted letters or
     words are surrounded with carets (<add>like this</add>); deleted words are represented by horizontal strike-out lines
     (<del>like
 this</del>); and deleted letters are indicated by vertical slashes (like this<del>s</del>). (This system of transcription
     is described in full in the <ref target="letters/MTDP00005.xml" type="crossref">Guide to Editorial Practice</ref>.) All revisions on
     manuscripts are Clemens’s, unless otherwise noted. The revisions on the typescripts are identified by Clemens’s initials,
     or the name of the reviser: “TS1-Harvey,” “TS2-SLC,” and “TS3-Munro,” for example, identify
     marks by George Harvey on TS1, Clemens on TS2, and David Munro on TS3. The entry associated with a reading is highlighted in the pop-up
     Textual Apparatus window.</p>, '\n', <lb></lb>, '\n', <table rend="form">

     spelling, and other formal features), with the exception of those listed below by category in <hi rend="italic">Silent
     emendations</hi>. It is necessary to review the list of variants to determine the source of the reading adopted in the text. If this
     reading is not among the variants listed, it has been supplied by the editors of this edition. The readings of the source documents are
     usually given in the order of historical occurrence—that is, a manuscript reading (if any) is listed first, followed by each
     subsequent text in the line of transmission. When feasible, the readings of the document that Clemens revised to serve as
     printer’s copy for the NAR are listed immediately before the readings in the NAR. Whenever an authoritative typescript is extant
     (such as TS1, TS2, and TS3), its variants are listed. The variants in TS4, which has less authority, are listed only if one of the
     other typescripts is missing or incomplete. Unless otherwise noted, Clemens used ink for his revisions and his collaborators used
     pencil. The medium of inscription, together with historical evidence, has often been the key to identifying the handwriting on the
     documents.</p>, '\n', <p rend="text-indent:2">Textual notes explain editorial decisions and provide pertinent information about unusual features of the source
     documents. There are two types: 1) notes that comprise the entire entry and provide information about a single source document; 2)
     notes combined with a list of variants that supplements or explains one of the listed readings or gives information about editorial
     decisions.</p>, '\n', <lb></lb>, '\n', <table rend="form">
